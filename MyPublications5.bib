  abstract = {This document describes the implementation of the external module ITKIsotropicWavelets, a multiresolution (MRA) analysis framework using isotropic and steerable wavelets in the frequency domain. This framework provides the backbone for state of the art filters for denoising, feature detection or phase analysis in N-dimensions. It focus on reusability, and highly decoupled modules for easy extension and implementation of new filters, and it contains a filter for multiresolution phase analysis, The backbone of the multi-scale analysis is provided by an isotropic band-limited wavelet pyramid, and the detection of directional features is provided by coupling the pyramid with a generalized Riesz transform. The generalized Riesz transform of order N behaves like a smoothed version of the Nth order derivatives of the signal. Also, it is steerable: its components impulse responses can be rotated to any spatial orientation, reducing computation time when detecting directional features.},

  abstract = {Polysaccharide gels assembled from the anionic biopolymers pectin and carrageenan have been studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Gels were formed in several different ways: for pectin, hydrogen bonding was used to form junction zones between strands, whereas for carrageenan systems, several different ion types were used to form ionotropic networks. Using this approach, several distinct network architectures were realized. In addition to preparing gelled samples for electron microscopy, a set of samples was taken without performing the additional treatment necessitated by the TEM measurements, and these were studied directly by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Taking careful consideration of the relative merits of different image sizes and available processing techniques, the real-space images acquired by TEM were used via radial integration of the Fourier transform to produce simulated scattering patterns. These intensity-versus-wavevector plots were compared with the results of SAXS experiments carried out on the unadulterated gels using synchrotron radiation. Although information regarding chain thicknesses and flexibilities was found to be modified by labeling and changes in the dielectric constant and mechanical properties of the surroundings in the TEM, the studies carried out here show that careful protocols can produce data sets where information acquired above $\sim$20 nm is broadly consistent with that obtained by SAXS studies carried out on unadulterated samples. The fact that at larger length scale the structure of these water-rich networks seems largely preserved in the TEM samples suggests that three-dimensional (3D) TEM tomography experiments carried out with careful sample preparation will be valuable tools for measuring network architecture and connectivity; information that is lost in SAXS owing to the intrinsic averaging nature of the technique.},

  title = {Automatic Quantification Framework to Detect Cracks in Teeth},
  volume = {10578},

  doi = {10.1117/12.2293603},
  abstract = {Studies show that cracked teeth are the third most common cause for tooth loss in industrialized countries. If detected early and accurately, patients can retain their teeth for a longer time. Most cracks are not detected early because of the discontinuous symptoms and lack of good diagnostic tools. Currently used imaging modalities like Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and intraoral radiography often have low sensitivity and do not show cracks clearly. This paper introduces a novel method that can detect, quantify, and localize cracks automatically in high resolution CBCT (hr-CBCT) scans of teeth using steerable wavelets and learning methods. These initial results were created using hr-CBCT scans of a set of healthy teeth and of teeth with simulated longitudinal cracks. The cracks were simulated using multiple orientations. The crack detection was trained on the most significant wavelet coefficients at each scale using a bagged classifier of Support Vector Machines. Our results show high discriminative specificity and sensitivity of this method. The framework aims to be automatic, reproducible, and open-source. Future work will focus on the clinical validation of the proposed techniques on different types of cracks ex-vivo. We believe that this work will ultimately lead to improved tracking and detection of cracks allowing for longer lasting healthy teeth.},

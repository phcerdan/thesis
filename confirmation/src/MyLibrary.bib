	abstract = {The success of the experimental program at the Tevatron re-inforced the idea that precision physics at hadron colliders is desirable and, indeed, possible. The Tevatron data strongly suggests that one-loop computations in {QCD} describe hard scattering well. Extrapolating this observation to the {LHC}, we conclude that knowledge of many short-distance processes at next-to-leading order may be required to describe the physics of hard scattering. While the field of one-loop computations is quite mature, parton multiplicities in hard {LHC} events are so high that traditional computational techniques become inefficient. Recently new approaches based on unitarity have been developed for calculating one-loop scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. These methods are especially suitable for the description of multi-particle processes in {QCD} and are amenable to numerical implementations. We present a systematic pedagogical description of both conceptual and technical aspects of the new methods.},

If there is a second sample, {y1,⋯,yMy\_1}, {\textbackslash}cdots, {y\_M}, a test of the hypothesis that the two samples come from the same (unspecified) continuous distribution can be based on the analogue of {Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2}, namely T=[{NM/(N+M)]∫∞−∞[FN(x)−GM(x)]2dHN+M(x)},(2){\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\}{\textbackslash}tag\{2\} T = {\textbackslash}lbrack {NM/(N} + M){\textbackslash}rbrack {\textbackslash}int{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}infty\_\{-{\textbackslash}infty\} {\textbackslash}lbrack {F\_N(x)} - {G\_M(x){\textbackslash}rbrack{\textasciicircum}2} {dH\_\{N+M\}(x)},{\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} where {GM(x)G\_M(x)} is the empirical distribution function of the second sample and {HN+M(x)H\_\{N+M\}(x)} is the empirical distribution function of the two samples together [that is, ({N+M)HN+M(x)=NFN(x)+MGM(x)](N} + {M)H\_\{N+M\}(x)} = {NF\_N(x)} + {MG\_M(x){\textbackslash}rbrack.} The limiting distribution of {Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2} as {N→∞N} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty has been tabulated [2], and it has been shown ([3], [4a], and [7]) that {TT} has the same limiting distribution as {N→∞,M→∞N} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty, M {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty, and {N/M→λN/M} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}lambda, where λ{\textbackslash}lambda is any finite positive constant. In this note we consider the distribution of {TT} for small values of {NN} and {MM} and present tables to permit use of the criterion at some conventional significance levels for small values of {NN} and {MM.} The limiting distribution seems a surprisingly good approximation to the exact distribution for moderate sample sizes (corresponding to the same feature for {Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2} [6]). The accuracy of approximation is better than in the case of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic studied by Hodges [4].},

The thresholding methods are categorized according to the information they are exploiting, such as histogram shape, measurement space clustering, entropy, object attributes, spatial correlation, and local gray-level surface. 40 selected thresholding methods from various categories are compared in the context of nondestructive testing applications as well as for document images. The comparison is based on the combined performance measures. We identify the thresholding algorithms that perform uniformly better over nondestructive testing and document image applications. © 2004 {SPIE} and {IS\&T.}},

	abstract = {Propulsion by growing actin networks is a universal mechanism used in many different biological systems, ranging from the sheet-like lamellipodium of crawling animal cells to the actin comet tails induced by certain bacteria and viruses in order to move within their host cells. Although the core molecular machinery for actin network growth is well preserved in all of these cases, the geometry of the propelled obstacle varies considerably. During recent years, filament orientation distribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the structure and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several continuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing behind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady state orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete filaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate that for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation patterns peaked at either ±35° or +70°/0°/ − 70° exhibit mutually exclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of very large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a function of model parameters and show how this approach can be extended to obstacles with piecewise straight contours. For curved obstacles, we arrive at a partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which again is in good agreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same two fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an appropriate reference frame, which is adjusted to the local orientation of the obstacle contour. Our results suggest that two fundamentally different network architectures compete with each other in growing actin networks, irrespective of obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data have to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.},

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of soft biological tissues are essential to their physiological function and cannot easily be duplicated by synthetic materials. Unlike simple polymer gels, many biological materials—including blood vessels, mesentery tissue, lung parenchyma, cornea and blood clots—stiffen as they are strained, thereby preventing large deformations that could threaten tissue integrity. The molecular structures and design principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress–strain relations at low to intermediate strains. The input to this theory is the force–extension curve for individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these filaments are homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly. This theory shows that systems of filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen at low strains without requiring a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffness.},

The topology of network graphs revealed small-world properties for very different real systems among these neuronal networks. In this study, we observed the early development of mouse retinal ganglion cell ({RGC)} networks in vitro using time-lapse video microscopy. By means of a time-resolved graph theoretical analysis of the connectivity, shortest path length and the edge length, we were able to discover the different stages during the network formation. Starting from single cells, at the first stage neurons connected to each other ending up in a network with maximum complexity. In the further course, we observed a simplification of the network which manifested in a change of relevant network parameters such as the minimization of the path length. Moreover, we found that {RGC} networks self-organized as small-world networks at both stages; however, the optimization occurred only in the second stage.},

	abstract = {Single-particle tracking ({SPT)} is of growing importance in the biophysical community. It is used to investigate processes such as drug and gene delivery, viral uptake, intracellular trafficking or membrane-bound protein mobility. Traditionally, {SPT} is performed in two dimensions ({2D)} because of its technical simplicity. However, life occurs in three dimensions ({3D)} and many methods have been recently developed to track particles in {3D.} Now, is the third dimension worth the effort? Here we investigate the differences between the {2D} and {3D} analyses of intracellular transport with the {3D} development of a time-resolved mean square displacement ({MSD)} analysis introduced previously. The {3D} trajectories, and the {2D} projections, of fluorescent nanoparticles were obtained with an orbital tracking microscope in two different cell types: in Dictyostelium discoideum ameba and in adherent, more flattened {HuH-7} human cells. As expected from the different {3D} organization of both cells’ cytoskeletons, a third of the active transport was lost upon projection in the ameba whereas the identification of the active phases was barely affected in the {HuH-7} cells. In both cell types, we found intracellular diffusion to be anisotropic and the diffusion coefficient values derived from the {2D} analysis were therefore biased.},

We analytically study the nonlinear force–extension relation of an array of parallel-aligned, strongly stretched semiflexible polymers with random cross-links. In the strong stretching limit, the effect of the cross-links is purely entropic, independent of the bending rigidity of the chains. Cross-links enhance the differential stretching stiffness of the bundle. For hard cross-links, the cross-link contribution to the force–extension relation scales inversely proportional to the force. Its dependence on the cross-link density, close to the gelation transition, is the same as that of the shear modulus. The qualitative behaviour is captured by a toy model of two chains with a single cross-link in the middle.},

This value forv agrees excellently with the field-theoretic renormalization-group prediction, but there is some discrepancy forΔ 1. Earlier Monte Carlo estimates ofv, which were ≈0.592, are now seen to be biased by corrections to scaling. We estimate the universal ratios {\textless}R g 2 {\textgreater}/{\textless}R e 2 {\textgreater}=0.1599±0.0002 and Ψ*=0.2471±0.0003; since Ψ*{\textgreater}0, hyperscaling holds. The approach to Ψ* is from above, contrary to the prediction of the two-parameter renormalization-group theory. We critically reexamine this theory, and explain where the error lies. In an appendix, we prove rigorously (modulo some standard scaling assumptions) the hyperscaling relationdv = 2Δ 4 −γ for two-dimensional {SAWs.}},

	abstract = {The Burgers equation is the simplest nonlinear generalization of the diffusion equation. We present a detailed dynamical renormalization-group analysis of this equation subject to random noise. The noise itself can be the product of another stochastic process and is hence allowed to have correlations in space and/or time. In dimensions higher than a critical dc weak and strong noise lead to different scaling exponents, while for d{\textless}dc any amount of noise is relevant resulting in strong-coupling behavior. In the absence of temporal correlations we find two regimes for d{\textless}dc: either the hydrodynamic behavior is determined by white noise and correlations are unimportant, or correlations dominate and the resulting scaling exponents can be obtained exactly. With temporal correlations present, the hydrodynamic behavior is much more complex, as renormalization predicts a complicated dependence of the effective noise spectrum on frequency in certain regimes. The relevance of these results to two interesting problems is discussed. One is the anomalous transverse fluctuations of a directed polymer in a random medium, and the other is a description of a growing interface. Various recent numerical simulations are reviewed in the light of these results. For example, we show that an exponent identity observed in all simulations so far follows simply from the Galilean invariance of the equation in the absence of temporal correlations.},

	abstract = {We report on a hitherto unnoticed type of resonances occurring in scattering from networks (quantum graphs) which are due to the complex connectivity of the graph—its topology. We consider generic open graphs and show that any cycle leads to narrow resonances which do not fit in any of the prominent paradigms for narrow resonances (classical barriers, localization due to disorder, chaotic scattering). We call these resonances “topological” to emphasize their origin in the nontrivial connectivity. Topological resonances have a clear and unique signature which is apparent in the statistics of the resonance parameters (such as, e.g., the width, the delay time, or the wave-function intensity in the graph). We discuss this phenomenon by providing analytical arguments supported by numerical simulation, and identify the features of the above distributions which depend on genuine topological quantities such as the length of the shortest cycle (girth). These signatures cannot be explained using any of the other paradigms for narrow resonances. Finally, we propose an experimental setting where the topological resonances could be demonstrated, and study the stability of the relevant distribution functions to moderate dissipation.},

	abstract = {Upon temperature changes, we observe a systematic shift of creep compliance curves J(t) for single living breast epithelial cells. We use a dual-beam laser trap (optical stretcher) to induce temperature jumps within milliseconds, while simultaneously measuring the mechanical response of whole cells to optical force. The cellular mechanical response was found to differ between sudden temperature changes compared to slow, long-term changes implying adaptation of cytoskeletal structure. Interpreting optically induced cell deformation as a thermorheological experiment allows us to consistently explain data on the basis of time–temperature superposition, well known from classical polymer physics. Measured time shift factors give access to the activation energy of the viscous flow of {MCF-10A} breast cells, which was determined to be ≈80 {kJ} mol−1. The presented measurements highlight the fundamental role that temperature plays for the deformability of cellular matter. We propose thermorheology as a powerful concept to assess the inherent material properties of living cells and to investigate cell regulatory responses upon environmental changes.},

Recent research has underscored its role as a dynamic, multifunctional muscle, whose passive and active mechanical performance is highly heterogeneous in space and time and intimately linked to many biological functions, such that it may serve as a sensitive indicator for the health or developmental state of the cell. In vitro reconstitution of 'functional modules' of the cytoskeleton is now seen as a way of balancing the mutually conflicting demands for simplicity, which is required for systematic and quantitative studies, and for a sufficient degree of complexity that allows a faithful representation of biological functions. This bottom-up strategy, aimed at unravelling biological complexity from its physical basis, builds on the latest advances in technology, experimental design and theoretical modelling, which are reviewed in this progress report.},

	abstract = {The theory of critical phenomena in systems at equilibrium is reviewed at an introductory level with special emphasis on the values of the critical point exponents α, β, γ,..., and their interrelations. The experimental observations are surveyed and the analogies between different physical systems - fluids, magnets, superfluids, binary alloys, etc. - are developed phenomenologically. An exact theoretical basis for the analogies follows from the equivalence between classical and quantal `lattice gases' and the Ising and Heisenberg-Ising magnetic models. General rigorous inequalities for critical exponents at and below Tc are derived. The nature and validity of the `classical' (phenomenological and mean field) theories are discussed, their predictions being contrasted with the exact results for plane Ising models, which are summarized concisely. Padé approximant and ratio techniques applied to appropriate series expansions lead to precise critical-point estimates for the three-dimensional Heisenberg and Ising models (tables of data are presented). With this background a critique is presented of recent theoretical ideas: namely, the `droplet' picture of the critical point and the `homogeneity' and `scaling' hypotheses. These lead to a `law of corresponding states' near a critical point and to relations between the various exponents which suggest that perhaps only two or three exponents might be algebraically independent for any system.},

	abstract = {Applications for porous fibrous materials range from electrochemical substrates to web reinforcement in polymeric composite materials. The details of local load transfer are studied in a class of cost-effective, stochastic fibrous networks used in battery applications, which form the substrate for a composite electrode. The connectivity of these materials is quantitatively related to modulus and strength, and detailed results of different simulations approaches in approximating material construction are discussed. In Part I, we discuss microscale assumptions, including beam type, nodal connections and equivalence of models to more physically realistic models. Simulation of large networks is computationally intensive, and show low-strain, nonlinear behavior even when comprised of elastic elements when failure criteria (here, strength-of-materials) are applied to produce sequential rupture of beams and nodes. Strategies for effective simulation of these materials requires detailed analysis of the simplest assumptions which can be made at the microscale which produce acceptably realistic response. We show that simple Euler-Bernoulli beam elements can be used to effectively model such materials, even when segment lengths in a network are very small. Moreover, connections comprised of simple torsion springs produce realistic behavior, and can mimic more realistic junctures by adaptation of the linear solution to a compliant zone model. In Part {II} of this work, we demonstrate the effect of model selection on full network behavior, and also discuss issues of connectivity at the scale of the porous material rather than element-by-element. This work points toward use of simple constructions to model complex behavior, and may ultimately provide insight into modeling of a large class of porous materials. [S0094-4289(00)01704-7]},

The solution of the s-wave Kondo Hamiltonian, describing a single magnetic impurity in a nonmagnetic metal, is explained in detail. See Secs. {VII-IX.} {"Block} spin" methods, applied to the two dimensional Ising model, are explained in Sec. {VI.} The first three sections give a relatively short review of basic renormalization group ideas, mainly in the context of critical phenomena. The relationship of the modern renormalization group to the older problems of divergences in statistical mechanics and field theory and field theoretic renormalization is discussed in Sec. {IV.} In Sec. V the special case of "marginal variables" is discussed in detail, along with the relationship of the modern renormalization group to its original formulation by Gell-Mann and Low and others.},

	abstract = {We present a study of exclusion processes on networks as models for complex transport phenomena, and in particular for active transport of motor proteins along the cytoskeleton. Specifically, we focus on the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ({TASEP)} as well as its generalizations including backstepping (partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ({PASEP))} and exchange with a bulk concentration ({TASEP} with Langmuir kinetics ({TASEP-LK)).} We build on the previously used effective rate approach to establish a general methodology in terms of effective rate diagrams, which allows for a simple classification of the stationary transport state of the total network. This approach is general and reveals generic features of exclusion processes on networks. Based on the three examples considered here, we show that the classification can be made in terms of three qualitative different network regimes: a homogeneous regime, a heterogeneous network regime and a heterogeneous segment regime. Using parameters representative of real motor proteins, we show how the transitions between these regimes can be regulated through a variety of multi-scale factors, such as the interplay of exclusion interactions, the non-equilibrium nature of the transport process, motor processivity and the network topology. Using the equilibrium limits of {PASEP} and {TASEP-LK}, we also shed further light on the emergence of density heterogeneities in active transport phenomena.},

	abstract = {A goal of complex system research is to identify the dynamical implications of network structure. While early results focused mainly on local or global structural properties, there is now growing interest in mesoscale structures that comprise more than one node but not the whole network. A central challenge is to discover under what conditions the occurrence of a specific mesoscale motif already allows conclusions on the dynamics of a network as a whole. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of ecological food webs, complex heterogeneous networks of interacting populations. Generalizing the results of {MacArthur} and Sánchez-García (2009 Phys. Rev. E 80 26117), we show that certain mesoscale symmetries imply the existence of localized dynamical modes. If these modes are unstable the occurrence of the corresponding mesoscale motif implies dynamical instability regardless of the structure of the embedding network. In contrast, if the mode is stable it means that the symmetry can be exploited to reduce the number of nodes in the model, without changing the dynamics of the system. This result explains a previously observed dynamical equivalence between food webs containing a different number of species.},

One such open puzzle is the observed pulses of backward-moving myosin-X in the filopodia structure. Motivated by this phenomenon we introduce two generalizations of the ‘total asymmetric exclusion process’ ({TASEP)} that might be relevant to the formation of such pulses. The first is adding a nearest-neighbours attractive interaction between motors, while the second is adding an internal degree of freedom corresponding to a processive and immobile form of the motors. Switching between the two states occurs stochastically, without a conservation law. Both models show strong deviations from the mean field behaviour and lack particle–hole symmetry. We use approximations borrowed from the research on vehicular traffic models to calculate the current and jam size distribution in a system with periodic boundary conditions and introduce a novel modification to one of these approximation schemes.},

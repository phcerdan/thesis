    abstract = {The microstructure of tissues and tissue equivalents ({TEs)} plays a critical role in determining the mechanical properties thereof. One of the key challenges in constitutive modeling of {TEs} is incorporating the kinematics at both the macroscopic and the microscopic scale. Models of fibrous microstructure commonly assume fibrils to move homogeneously, that is affine with the macroscopic deformation. While intuitive for situations of fibril-matrix load transfer, the relevance of the affine assumption is less clear when primary load transfer is from fibril to fibril. The microstructure of {TEs} is a hydrated network of collagen fibrils, making its microstructural kinematics an open question. Numerical simulation of uniaxial extensile behavior in planar {TE} networks was performed with fibril kinematics dictated by the network model and by the affine model. The average fibril orientation evolved similarly with strain for both models. The individual fibril kinematics, however, were markedly different. There was no correlation between fibril strain and orientation in the network model, and fibril strains were contained by extensive reorientation. As a result, the macroscopic stress given by the network model was roughly threefold lower than the affine model. Also, the network model showed a toe region, where fibril reorientation precluded the development of significant fibril strain. We conclude that network fibril kinematics are not governed by affine principles, an important consideration in the understanding of tissue and {TE} mechanics, especially when load bearing is primarily by an interconnected fibril network.},

Each component of the {VD} is attributed with a measure of prominence which exhibits the expected invariance under geometric transformations and noise.

    abstract = {The skeleton is an important representation for shape analysis. A common approach for generating discrete skeletons takes three steps: 1) computing the distance map, 2) detecting maximal disks from the distance map, and 3) linking the centers of maximal disks ({CMDs)} into a connected skeleton. Algorithms using approximate distance metrics are abundant and their theory has been well established. However, the resulting skeletons may be inaccurate and sensitive to rotation. In this paper, we study methods for generating skeletons based on the exact Euclidean metric. We first show that no previous algorithms identify the exact set of discrete maximal disks under the Euclidean metric. We then propose new algorithms and show that they are correct. To link {CMDs} into connected skeletons, we examine two prevalent approaches: connected thinning and steepest ascent. We point out that the connected thinning approach does not work properly for Euclidean distance maps. Only the steepest ascent algorithm produces skeletons that are truly medially placed. The resulting skeletons have all the desirable properties: they have the same simple connectivity as the figure, they are well-centered, they are insensitive to rotation, and they allow exact reconstruction. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated with numerous examples},

In this study, we show that the macroscopic network response of reconstituted actin networks can be traced back to the microscopic interaction potential of an individual {actin/ABP} bond. The viscoelastic response of cross-linked actin networks is set by the cross-linker off-rate, the binding energy, and the characteristic bond length of individual {actin/ABP} interactions.},

The Tevatron data strongly suggests that one-loop computations in {QCD} describe hard scattering well. Extrapolating this observation to the {LHC}, we conclude that knowledge of many short-distance processes at next-to-leading order may be required to describe the physics of hard scattering. While the field of one-loop computations is quite mature, parton multiplicities in hard {LHC} events are so high that traditional computational techniques become inefficient. Recently new approaches based on unitarity have been developed for calculating one-loop scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. These methods are especially suitable for the description of multi-particle processes in {QCD} and are amenable to numerical implementations. We present a systematic pedagogical description of both conceptual and technical aspects of the new methods.},

If there is a second sample, {y1,⋯,yMy\_1}, {\textbackslash}cdots, {y\_M}, a test of the hypothesis that the two samples come from the same (unspecified) continuous distribution can be based on the analogue of {Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2}, namely T=[{NM/(N+M)]∫∞−∞[FN(x)−GM(x)]2dHN+M(x)},(2){\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\}{\textbackslash}tag\{2\} T = {\textbackslash}lbrack {NM/(N} + M){\textbackslash}rbrack {\textbackslash}int{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}infty\_\{-{\textbackslash}infty\} {\textbackslash}lbrack {F\_N(x)} - {G\_M(x){\textbackslash}rbrack{\textasciicircum}2} {dH\_\{N+M\}(x)},{\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} where {GM(x)G\_M(x)} is the empirical distribution function of the second sample and {HN+M(x)H\_\{N+M\}(x)} is the empirical distribution function of the two samples together [that is, ({N+M)HN+M(x)=NFN(x)+MGM(x)](N} + {M)H\_\{N+M\}(x)} = {NF\_N(x)} + {MG\_M(x){\textbackslash}rbrack.} The limiting distribution of {Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2} as {N→∞N} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty has been tabulated [2], and it has been shown ([3], [4a], and [7]) that {TT} has the same limiting distribution as {N→∞,M→∞N} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty, M {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty, and {N/M→λN/M} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}lambda, where λ{\textbackslash}lambda is any finite positive constant. In this note we consider the distribution of {TT} for small values of {NN} and {MM} and present tables to permit use of the criterion at some conventional significance levels for small values of {NN} and {MM.} The limiting distribution seems a surprisingly good approximation to the exact distribution for moderate sample sizes (corresponding to the same feature for {Nω2N{\textbackslash}omega{\textasciicircum}2} [6]). The accuracy of approximation is better than in the case of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic studied by Hodges [4].},

The mechanical stiffness can vary by several decades with small changes in cross-link concentration, and can increase markedly upon application of external stress.

	abstract = {The kinetic Monte Carlo simulation was used to predict the characteristics of the polymer network formation during pre- and postgelation regimes of free-radical cross-linking copolymerization. The simulation naturally considers the presence of multiradicals, primary and secondary cyclization with no preassumptions. The simulation was first validated in the pregel regime by comparing the microstructure with that given by a mean-field model. The Monte Carlo simulation was then used to predict the kinetics and development of the polymer microstructure of the sol and gel fractions up to full conversion, including the complete molecular weight distribution, cross-linking and pendant double bond densities, primary and secondary cyclization and the molecular weight distribution between cross-linking points. The simulation also allows studying the presence and evolution of multiradicals along the polymerization.},

	abstract = {This white paper is an explanation of Ben and Dave's {TARDIS} time machine, written for laypeople who are interested in time travel, but have no technical knowledge of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. The first part of this paper is an introduction to the pertinent ideas from Einstein's theory of curved spacetime, followed by a review of other popular time machine spacetimes. We begin with an introduction to curvature and lightcones. We then explain the Alcubierre Warp Drive, the Morris-Thorne wormhole, and the Tipler cylinder. We then describe the Traversable Achronal Retrograde Domain in Spacetime ({TARDIS)}, and explain some of its general properties. Our {TARDIS} is a bubble of spacetime curvature which travels along a closed loop in space and time. A person travelling within the bubble will feel a constant acceleration. A person outside of the {TARDIS} will see two bubbles: one which is evolving forwards in time, and one which is evolving backwards in time. We then discuss the physical limitations which may prevent us from ever constructing a {TARDIS.} Finally, we discuss the method through which a {TARDIS} can be used to travel between arbitrary points in space and time, and the possible dangers involved with exiting a {TARDIS} from the wrong side.

	doi = {10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.02.002},
	abstract = {Dynamic oscillatory shear tests are common in rheology and have been used to investigate a wide range of soft matter and complex fluids including polymer melts and solutions, block copolymers, biological macromolecules, polyelectrolytes, surfactants, suspensions, emulsions and beyond. More specifically, small amplitude oscillatory shear ({SAOS)} tests have become the canonical method for probing the linear viscoelastic properties of these complex fluids because of the firm theoretical background [1–4] and the ease of implementing suitable test protocols. However, in most processing operations the deformations can be large and rapid: it is therefore the nonlinear material properties that control the system response. A full sample characterization thus requires well-defined nonlinear test protocols. Consequently there has been a recent renewal of interest in exploiting large amplitude oscillatory shear ({LAOS)} tests to investigate and quantify the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of complex fluids. In terms of the experimental input, both {LAOS} and {SAOS} require the user to select appropriate ranges of strain amplitude (γ0) and frequency (ω). However, there is a distinct difference in the analysis of experimental output, i.e. the material response. At sufficiently large strain amplitude, the material response will become nonlinear in {LAOS} tests and the familiar material functions used to quantify the linear behavior in {SAOS} tests are no longer sufficient. For example, the definitions of the linear viscoelastic moduli G′(ω) and G″(ω) are based inherently on the assumption that the stress response is purely sinusoidal (linear). However, a nonlinear stress response is not a perfect sinusoid and therefore the viscoelastic moduli are not uniquely defined; other methods are needed for quantifying the nonlinear material response under {LAOS} deformation. In the present review article, we first summarize the typical nonlinear responses observed with complex fluids under {LAOS} deformations. We then introduce and critically compare several methods that quantify the nonlinear oscillatory stress response. We illustrate the utility and sensitivity of these protocols by investigating the nonlinear response of various complex fluids over a wide range of frequency and amplitude of deformation, and show that {LAOS} characterization is a rigorous test for rheological models and advanced quality control.},

	abstract = {We present a simple strategy in order to show the existence and uniqueness of the infinite volume limit of thermodynamic quantities, for a large class of mean field disordered models, as for example the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, and the Derrida p-spin model. The main argument is based on a smooth interpolation between a large system, made of N spin sites, and two similar but independent subsystems, made of N\_1 and N\_2 sites, respectively, with {N\_1+N\_2=N.} The quenched average of the free energy turns out to be subadditive with respect to the size of the system. This gives immediately convergence of the free energy per site, in the infinite volume limit. Moreover, a simple argument, based on concentration of measure, gives the almost sure convergence, with respect to the external noise. Similar results hold also for the ground state energy per site.},

	abstract = {In this report we review the fundamentals, applications and future tendencies of dynamic atomic force microscopy ({AFM)} methods. Our focus is on understanding why the changes observed in the dynamic properties of a vibrating tip that interacts with a surface make possible to obtain molecular resolution images of membrane proteins in aqueous solutions or to resolve atomic-scale surface defects in ultra high vacuum ({UHV).} Our description of the two major dynamic {AFM} modes, amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy ({AM-AFM)} and frequency modulation atomic force microscopy ({FM-AFM)} emphasises their common points without ignoring the differences in experimental set-ups and operating conditions. Those differences are introduced by the different feedback parameters, oscillation amplitude in {AM-AFM} and frequency shift and excitation amplitude in {FM-AFM}, used to track the topography and composition of a surface.

The theoretical analysis of {AM-AFM} (also known as tapping-mode) emphasises the coexistence, in many situations of interests, of two stable oscillation states, a low and high amplitude solution. The coexistence of those oscillation states is a consequence of the presence of attractive and repulsive components in the interaction force and their non-linear dependence on the tip–surface separation. We show that key relevant experimental properties such as the lateral resolution, image contrast and sample deformation are highly dependent on the oscillation state chosen to operate the instrument. {AM-AFM} allows to obtain simultaneous topographic and compositional contrast in heterogeneous samples by recording the phase angle difference between the external excitation and the tip motion (phase imaging). Significant applications of {AM-AFM} such as high-resolution imaging of biomolecules and polymers, large-scale patterning of silicon surfaces, manipulation of single nanoparticles or the fabrication of single electron devices are also reviewed.

{FM-AFM} (also called non-contact {AFM—NC-AFM)} has achieved the long-standing goal of true atomic resolution with {AFM} in {UHV.} Our analysis starts with a discussion of the relation between frequency shifts and tip–surface interactions, emphasising the ability of perturbation theory to describe the measured frequency shift. We discuss the role of short-range chemical interactions in the atomic contrast, with particular attention to semiconductor and ionic (alkali halides and oxides) surfaces. Also included is a detailed quantitative comparison between theoretical simulations and experiment. Inversion procedures, the determination of the tip–sample interaction from the frequency shift versus distance curves above specific sites, are also reviewed. We finish with a discussion of the optimal range of experimental operation parameters, and the use of damping (excitation amplitude) as a source of atomic contrast, including the possible interpretation in terms of microscopic dissipation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Propulsion by growing actin networks is a universal mechanism used in many different biological systems, ranging from the sheet-like lamellipodium of crawling animal cells to the actin comet tails induced by certain bacteria and viruses in order to move within their host cells. Although the core molecular machinery for actin network growth is well preserved in all of these cases, the geometry of the propelled obstacle varies considerably. During recent years, filament orientation distribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the structure and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several continuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing behind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady state orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete filaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate that for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation patterns peaked at either ±35° or +70°/0°/ − 70° exhibit mutually exclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of very large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a function of model parameters and show how this approach can be extended to obstacles with piecewise straight contours. For curved obstacles, we arrive at a partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which again is in good agreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same two fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an appropriate reference frame, which is adjusted to the local orientation of the obstacle contour. Our results suggest that two fundamentally different network architectures compete with each other in growing actin networks, irrespective of obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data have to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.},

Unlike simple polymer gels, many biological materials—including blood vessels, mesentery tissue, lung parenchyma, cornea and blood clots—stiffen as they are strained, thereby preventing large deformations that could threaten tissue integrity. The molecular structures and design principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress–strain relations at low to intermediate strains. The input to this theory is the force–extension curve for individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these filaments are homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly. This theory shows that systems of filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen at low strains without requiring a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffness.},

	abstract = {Atomic force microscope manipulations of single polysaccharide molecules have recently expanded conformational chemistry to include force-driven transitions between the chair and boat conformers of the pyranose ring structure. We now expand these observations to include chair inversion, a common phenomenon in the conformational chemistry of six-membered ring molecules. We demonstrate that by stretching single pectin molecules (1 → 4-linked α-d-galactouronic acid polymer), we could change the pyranose ring conformation from a chair to a boat and then to an inverted chair in a clearly resolved two-step conversion: {4C1} ⇄ boat ⇄ {1C4.} The two-step extension of the distance between the glycosidic oxygen atoms O1 and O4 determined by atomic force microscope manipulations is corroborated by ab initio calculations of the increase in length of the residue vector {O1O4} on chair inversion. We postulate that this conformational change results from the torque generated by the glycosidic bonds when a force is applied to the pectin molecule. Hence, the glycosidic bonds act as mechanical levers, driving the conformational transitions of the pyranose ring. When the glycosidic bonds are equatorial (e), the torque is zero, causing no conformational change. However, when the glycosidic bond is axial (a), torque is generated, causing a rotation around {C—C} bonds and a conformational change. This hypothesis readily predicts the number of transitions observed in pyranose monomers with 1a-4a linkages (two), 1a-4e (one), and 1e-4e (none). Our results demonstrate single-molecule mechanochemistry with the capability of resolving complex conformational transitions.},

The universal ratios such as Flory’s intrinsic viscosity constant, the {Flory–Scheraga–Mandelkern} parameter, etc., are estimated from the first order ε‐expansion theory (ε=4−d, d being the spatial dimensionality). The results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental results in both the nondraining Gaussian and nondraining self‐avoiding limits. Preaveraging the Oseen tensor makes the value of the intrinsic viscosity about 10\% larger according to the first order ε‐expansion calculation.},

This model is widely used as standard model for describing conformations and force vs. extension curves of stiff polymers. It is shown that semiflexible polymers in d=2 show a crossover from hard rods to self-avoiding walks, the intermediate Gaussian regime (implied by the Kratky-Porod model) is completely absent. Hence the latter can also describe force vs. extension curves only if the contour length is only a few times larger than the persistence length.

Investigating the thermodynamic equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium behavior of such materials around second order phase transitions call for special techniques. We set up a renormalization group scheme by expanding an arbitrary scalar field living on the nodes of an arbitrary network, in terms of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian. The renormalization transformation involves, as usual, the integration over the more rapidly varying components of the field, corresponding to eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues, and then rescaling. The critical exponents depend on the particular graph through the spectral density of the eigenvalues.},

The topology of network graphs revealed small-world properties for very different real systems among these neuronal networks. In this study, we observed the early development of mouse retinal ganglion cell ({RGC)} networks in vitro using time-lapse video microscopy. By means of a time-resolved graph theoretical analysis of the connectivity, shortest path length and the edge length, we were able to discover the different stages during the network formation. Starting from single cells, at the first stage neurons connected to each other ending up in a network with maximum complexity. In the further course, we observed a simplification of the network which manifested in a change of relevant network parameters such as the minimization of the path length. Moreover, we found that {RGC} networks self-organized as small-world networks at both stages; however, the optimization occurred only in the second stage.},

Without excluded volume (phantom), both polymeric fractals obey Gaussian elasticity on larger scales determined by their spectral dimension. On the other hand, the swelling effect due to excluded volume is rather distinct between the two polymeric fractals: Self-avoiding Sierpinski gaskets can be described using a Flory-type mean-field argument. Sierpinski carpets having a spectral dimension closer to perfect membranes are significantly more strongly swollen than predicted. Based on our simulation results it cannot be excluded that Sierpinski carpets in athermal solvent show a flat phase on larger scales. We tested the self-consistency of Flory predictions using a virial expansion to higher orders.

The audience is mainly first-year graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however. The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is, arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and instantons via path integrals. For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic) of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field theory.},

	abstract = {A systematic analysis of the {Burgers–Kardar-Parisi-Zhang} equation in d+1 dimensions by dynamic renormalization-group theory is described. The fixed points and exponents are calculated to two-loop order. We use the dimensional regularization scheme, carefully keeping the full d dependence originating from the angular parts of the loop integrals. For dimensions less than dc=2 we find a strong-coupling fixed point, which diverges at d=2, indicating that there is nonperturbative strong-coupling behavior for all d≥2. At d=1 our method yields the identical fixed point as in the one-loop approximation, and the two-loop contributions to the scaling functions are nonsingular. For d{\textgreater}2 dimensions, there is no finite strong-coupling fixed point. In the framework of a 2+ε expansion, we find the dynamic exponent corresponding to the unstable fixed point, which described the nonequilibrium roughening transition, to be {z=2+O(ε3)}, in agreement with a recent scaling argument by Doty and Kosterlitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 1979 (1992)]. Similarly, our result for the correlation length exponent at the transition is {1/ν=ε+O(ε3).} For the smooth phase, some aspects of the crossover from Gaussian to critical behavior are discussed.},

	abstract = {Single-particle tracking ({SPT)} is of growing importance in the biophysical community. It is used to investigate processes such as drug and gene delivery, viral uptake, intracellular trafficking or membrane-bound protein mobility. Traditionally, {SPT} is performed in two dimensions ({2D)} because of its technical simplicity. However, life occurs in three dimensions ({3D)} and many methods have been recently developed to track particles in {3D.} Now, is the third dimension worth the effort? Here we investigate the differences between the {2D} and {3D} analyses of intracellular transport with the {3D} development of a time-resolved mean square displacement ({MSD)} analysis introduced previously. The {3D} trajectories, and the {2D} projections, of fluorescent nanoparticles were obtained with an orbital tracking microscope in two different cell types: in Dictyostelium discoideum ameba and in adherent, more flattened {HuH-7} human cells. As expected from the different {3D} organization of both cells’ cytoskeletons, a third of the active transport was lost upon projection in the ameba whereas the identification of the active phases was barely affected in the {HuH-7} cells. In both cell types, we found intracellular diffusion to be anisotropic and the diffusion coefficient values derived from the {2D} analysis were therefore biased.},

We analytically study the nonlinear force–extension relation of an array of parallel-aligned, strongly stretched semiflexible polymers with random cross-links. In the strong stretching limit, the effect of the cross-links is purely entropic, independent of the bending rigidity of the chains. Cross-links enhance the differential stretching stiffness of the bundle. For hard cross-links, the cross-link contribution to the force–extension relation scales inversely proportional to the force. Its dependence on the cross-link density, close to the gelation transition, is the same as that of the shear modulus. The qualitative behaviour is captured by a toy model of two chains with a single cross-link in the middle.},

	abstract = {We make a high-precision Monte Carlo study of two- and three-dimensional self-avoiding walks ({SAWs)} of length up to 80,000 steps, using the pivot algorithm and the Karp-Luby algorithm. We study the critical exponentsv and 2Δ 4 −γ as well as several universal amplitude ratios; in particular, we make an extremely sensitive test of the hyperscaling relationdv = 2Δ 4 −γ. In two dimensions, we confirm the predicted exponentv=3/4 and the hyperscaling relation; we estimate the universal ratios {\textless}R g 2 {\textgreater}/{\textless}R e 2 {\textgreater}=0.14026±0.00007, {\textless}R m 2 {\textgreater}/{\textless}R e 2 {\textgreater}=0.43961±0.00034, and Ψ*=0.66296±0.00043 (68\% confidence limits). In three dimensions, we estimatev=0.5877±0.0006 with a correctionto-scaling exponentΔ 1=0.56±0.03 (subjective 68\% confidence limits). This value forv agrees excellently with the field-theoretic renormalization-group prediction, but there is some discrepancy forΔ 1. Earlier Monte Carlo estimates ofv, which were ≈0.592, are now seen to be biased by corrections to scaling. We estimate the universal ratios {\textless}R g 2 {\textgreater}/{\textless}R e 2 {\textgreater}=0.1599±0.0002 and Ψ*=0.2471±0.0003; since Ψ*{\textgreater}0, hyperscaling holds. The approach to Ψ* is from above, contrary to the prediction of the two-parameter renormalization-group theory. We critically reexamine this theory, and explain where the error lies. In an appendix, we prove rigorously (modulo some standard scaling assumptions) the hyperscaling relationdv = 2Δ 4 −γ for two-dimensional {SAWs.}},

	abstract = {The Burgers equation is the simplest nonlinear generalization of the diffusion equation. We present a detailed dynamical renormalization-group analysis of this equation subject to random noise. The noise itself can be the product of another stochastic process and is hence allowed to have correlations in space and/or time. In dimensions higher than a critical dc weak and strong noise lead to different scaling exponents, while for d{\textless}dc any amount of noise is relevant resulting in strong-coupling behavior. In the absence of temporal correlations we find two regimes for d{\textless}dc: either the hydrodynamic behavior is determined by white noise and correlations are unimportant, or correlations dominate and the resulting scaling exponents can be obtained exactly. With temporal correlations present, the hydrodynamic behavior is much more complex, as renormalization predicts a complicated dependence of the effective noise spectrum on frequency in certain regimes. The relevance of these results to two interesting problems is discussed. One is the anomalous transverse fluctuations of a directed polymer in a random medium, and the other is a description of a growing interface. Various recent numerical simulations are reviewed in the light of these results. For example, we show that an exponent identity observed in all simulations so far follows simply from the Galilean invariance of the equation in the absence of temporal correlations.},

The model adapts existing models in order to accommodate one or more force-induced conformational transformations of the glycan rings and is based on the concept of equilibrium between the clicked (longer conformers) and unclicked states. This equilibrium is determined by the Gibbs energy difference between these two states which is perturbed in favor of the clicked states by the force applied to the molecule. The derived expression is used to generate force-extension curves for model polymers and can illustrate the effect of the Gibbs energy for each transformation on the shape of these curves. It is also used to fit the force-extension curves of polysaccharides to obtain the Gibbs energy differences between the conformers. Good agreement was found between this model and experimental data on carboxymethylamylose, dextran, alginate, and pectin.},

This requires working in the continuum plane, so making a precise definition is not trivial. We introduce an axiomatization of a class of processes we call scale-invariant random spatial networks, whose primitives are routes between each pair of points in the plane. One concrete model, based on minimum-time routes in a binary hierarchy of roads with different speed limits, has been shown to satisfy the axioms, and two other constructions (based on Poisson line processes and on dynamic proximity graphs) are expected also to do so. We initiate study of structure theory and summary statistics for general processes in the class. Many questions arise in this setting via analogies with diverse existing topics, from geodesics in first-passage percolation to transit node-based route-finding algorithms.},

We consider generic open graphs and show that any cycle leads to narrow resonances which do not fit in any of the prominent paradigms for narrow resonances (classical barriers, localization due to disorder, chaotic scattering). We call these resonances “topological” to emphasize their origin in the nontrivial connectivity. Topological resonances have a clear and unique signature which is apparent in the statistics of the resonance parameters (such as, e.g., the width, the delay time, or the wave-function intensity in the graph). We discuss this phenomenon by providing analytical arguments supported by numerical simulation, and identify the features of the above distributions which depend on genuine topological quantities such as the length of the shortest cycle (girth). These signatures cannot be explained using any of the other paradigms for narrow resonances. Finally, we propose an experimental setting where the topological resonances could be demonstrated, and study the stability of the relevant distribution functions to moderate dissipation.},

	abstract = {The same fundamental questions that have driven enquiry into cytoskeletal mechanics can be asked of the considerably less-studied, yet arguably just as important, biopolymer matrix in the plant cell wall. In this case, it is well-known that polysaccharides, rather than filamentous and tubular protein assemblies, play a major role in satisfying the mechanical requirements of a successful cell wall, but developing a clear structure–function understanding has been exacerbated by the familiar issue of biological complexity. Herein, in the spirit of the mesoscopic approaches that have proved so illuminating in the study of cytoskeletal networks, the linear microrheological and strain-stiffening responses of biopolymeric networks reconstituted from pectin, a crucial cell wall polysaccharide, are examined. These are found to be well-captured by the glassy worm-like chain ({GWLC)} model of self-assembled semi-flexible filaments. Strikingly, the nonlinear mechanical response of these pectin networks is found to be much more sensitive to temperature changes than their linear response, a property that is also observed in F-actin networks, and is well reproduced by the {GWLC} model. Additionally, microrheological measurements suggest that over long timescales ({\textgreater}10 s) internal stresses continue to redistribute facilitating low frequency motions of tracer particles.},

	abstract = {How do molecules interact with each other? What happens if a neurotransmitter binds to a ligand-operated ion channel? How do antibodies recognize their antigens? Molecular recognition events play a pivotal role in nature: in enzymatic catalysis and during the replication and transcription of the genome; it is also important for the cohesion of cellular structures and in numerous metabolic reactions that molecules interact with each other in a specific manner. Conventional methods such as calorimetry provide very precise values of binding enthalpies; these are, however, average values obtained from a large ensemble of molecules without knowledge of the dynamics of the molecular recognition event. Which forces occur when a single molecular couple meets and forms a bond? Since the development of the scanning force microscope and force spectroscopy a couple of years ago, tools have now become available for measuring the forces between interfaces with high precision-starting from colloidal forces to the interaction of single molecules. The manipulation of individual molecules using force spectroscopy is also possible. In this way, the mechanical properties on a molecular scale are measurable. The study of single molecules is not an exclusive domain of force spectroscopy; it can also be performed with a surface force apparatus, laser tweezers, or the micropipette technique. Regardless of these techniques, force spectroscopy has been proven as an extraordinary versatile tool. The intention of this review article is to present a critical evaluation of the actual development of static force spectroscopy. The article mainly focuses on experiments dealing with inter- and intramolecular forces-starting with "simple" electrostatic forces, then ligand-receptor systems, and finally the stretching of individual molecules.},

	abstract = {Force-extension (F-x) relationships were measured for single molecules of {DNA} under a variety of buffer conditions, using an optical trapping interferometer modified to incorporate feedback control. One end of a single {DNA} molecule was fixed to a coverglass surface by means of a stalled {RNA} polymerase complex. The other end was linked to a microscopic bead, which was captured and held in an optical trap. The {DNA} was subsequently stretched by moving the coverglass with respect to the trap using a piezo-driven stage, while the position of the bead was recorded at nanometer-scale resolution. An electronic feedback circuit was activated to prevent bead movement beyond a preset clamping point by modulating the light intensity, altering the trap stiffness dynamically. This arrangement permits rapid determination of the F-x relationship for individual {DNA} molecules as short as -1 micron with unprecedented accuracy, subjected to both low (approximately 0.1 {pN)} and high (approximately 50 {pN)} loads: complete data sets are acquired in under a minute. Experimental F-x relationships were fit over much of their range by entropic elasticity theories based on worm-like chain models. Fits yielded a persistence length, Lp, of approximately 47 nm in a buffer containing 10 {mM} Na1. Multivalent cations, such as Mg2+ or spermidine 3+, reduced Lp to approximately 40 nm. Although multivalent ions shield most of the negative charges on the {DNA} backbone, they did not further reduce Lp significantly, suggesting that the intrinsic persistence length remains close to 40 nm. An elasticity theory incorporating both enthalpic and entropic contributions to stiffness fit the experimental results extremely well throughout the full range of extensions and returned an elastic modulus of approximately 1100 {pN.}},

The simplest architecture is a pom-pom composed of a linear spacer and two z-arm stars at its ends resulting in z-fold tension amplification.

Using this model we show how motor activity can dramatically increase the network’s bulk elastic moduli. We also show how motor binding kinetics naturally leads to enhanced low-frequency stress fluctuations that result in nonequilibrium diffusive motion within an elastic network, as seen in recent in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

These cytoskeletal networks, together with various cross-linking and other associated proteins largely determine the (visco)elastic response of cells. In this Letter we study a model system of cross-linked, stiff filaments in order to explore the connection between the microstructure under strain and the macroscopic response of cytoskeletal networks. We find two distinct regimes as a function primarily of cross-link density and filament rigidity: one characterized by affine deformation and one by nonaffine deformation. We characterize the crossover between these two.},

	abstract = {Upon temperature changes, we observe a systematic shift of creep compliance curves J(t) for single living breast epithelial cells. We use a dual-beam laser trap (optical stretcher) to induce temperature jumps within milliseconds, while simultaneously measuring the mechanical response of whole cells to optical force. The cellular mechanical response was found to differ between sudden temperature changes compared to slow, long-term changes implying adaptation of cytoskeletal structure. Interpreting optically induced cell deformation as a thermorheological experiment allows us to consistently explain data on the basis of time–temperature superposition, well known from classical polymer physics. Measured time shift factors give access to the activation energy of the viscous flow of {MCF-10A} breast cells, which was determined to be ≈80 {kJ} mol−1. The presented measurements highlight the fundamental role that temperature plays for the deformability of cellular matter. We propose thermorheology as a powerful concept to assess the inherent material properties of living cells and to investigate cell regulatory responses upon environmental changes.},

	abstract = {Amorphous solids fall into any reasonable definition of a solid. This means that it should be possible to describe amorphous solids in terms of an expansion in deviations from a well defined rigid microscopic reference frame — as in the Cauchy-Born lattice-dynamics of periodic crystals. The continuum limit of this microscopic expansion is a field theory — continuum elasticity. It follows that different types of amorphous solids can differ from each other and from crystalline solids only because of differences in the nature of their microscopic reference states. A theory of amorphous solids which implements this general point of view must satisfy two very general restrictions: (1) translation-rotation invariance of the expansion and (2) the reference state must be a stable equilibrium state. We construct such a general theory and also describe some results of its application to specific types of amorphous solids. The monograph consists of three parts.

Part I. The Cauchy-Born Theory of Solids, describes a general and explicitly translation-rotation invariant formulation of the Cauchy-Born expansion. This is done by using the fact that the translation-rotation invariant energy of a many particle system can be regarded as a function of the interparticle distances. The resulting formalism leads to local expressions for the continuum limit which can be used to derive microscopic expressions for the local elastic constants and for the stresses from the coefficients in the microscopic expansion around a specific reference state. One finds that the initial stresses in the microscopic reference state lead to special stress induced terms in the harmonic expansion whose continuum limit is the second order strain. Their effect on the bulk stability of the reference states of tenuous solids is closely analogous to the role of stresses in continuum stability theory.

Part {II.} The Rigidity of Floppy Bonded Networks, studies the stability of tenuous reference states. The theory developed in this section extends the standard considerations of the effect of stresses on the elastic stability of thin rods and shells to the complex internal structures which describe the bulk of solids. There is a geometric aspect. The interaction scheme of a physical model, the bond structure, defines a graph — the bonded network. When this network can be deformed continuously in d-dimensions even when all its bonded distances are fixed is geometrically floppy. A model which is described by such a network has a manifold of free degrees of freedom which have no rigidity for unstressed reference states. Mostly the free modes describe collective deformations of the reference state. We show that their number can be very large and that they often constitute a significant fraction of all eigenmodes. Like the bending of a thin rod these free modes are sensitive to stresses in the reference state around which one is expanding. When there are stresses they can become unstable, leading to structural buckling instabilities, or stable — depending on the sign of the relevant stresses. The theory of floppy networks thus allows us to study structural buckling, the bulk analog of the Euler buckling of rods and shells, and the stabilization of bulk shears by stretching which is the origin of the shear rigidity of most soft solids.

Part {III.} The Role of Stresses in Amorphous Solids, applies these results. The emphasis is on the stability of the reference state. We require stability against structural buckling and on the role of stresses in stabilizing the soft modes of tenuous bonding structures. The shear rigidity of rubbers and wet gel-likes is that of floppy bonded networks which are stretched. Like the shear rigidity of stretched membranes it is that of a network of stretched springs. We show that this is possible only because such solids are not rigid down to the atomic level. We discuss the stability of stressed granular packings emphasizing the fact that the packing has to be stable against structural buckling. This gives considerable insight into the internal mechanics of granular packings because it not only considers the equilibrium conditions on the individual grains but also the collective linear stability of a stressed packing. We then describe a new model of quenched glasses which emphasizes the role of the internal stresses in the glass. The essence of this model is the distinction between the molecular configuration in the quenched liquid, the “snapshot state” and the stable equilibrium reference state of the glass which emerges from it even for the most rapid ideal quench. We argue that structural buckling dominates the restructuring in the ideal quench and show that this predicts strong correlations between the local structure of the reference state and the internal stresses. Some of the most striking properties of glasses appear naturally in this microscopic model.},

In vitro reconstitution of 'functional modules' of the cytoskeleton is now seen as a way of balancing the mutually conflicting demands for simplicity, which is required for systematic and quantitative studies, and for a sufficient degree of complexity that allows a faithful representation of biological functions.

Non-diffusive slow dynamics and aging in materials characterised by crowding of the constituents can be explained in terms of structural rearrangement or remodelling events that occur within the jammed state. In this context, we introduce the jamming phase diagram proposed by Liu and Nagel to understand the ergodic-nonergodic transition in these systems, and discuss recent theoretical attempts to explain the unusual, faster-than-exponential dynamical structure factors observed in jammed soft materials. We next focus on the anomalous rheology (flow and deformation behaviour) ubiquitous in soft matter characterised by metastability and structural disorder, and refer to the Soft Glassy Rheology ({SGR)} model that quantifies the mechanical response of these systems and predicts aging under suitable conditions. As part of a survey of experimental work related to these issues, we present x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy ({XPCS)} results of the aging of laponite clay suspensions following rejuvenation. We conclude by exploring the scientific literature for recent theoretical advances in the understanding of these models and for experimental investigations aimed at testing their predictions.},

The experimental observations are surveyed and the analogies between different physical systems - fluids, magnets, superfluids, binary alloys, etc. - are developed phenomenologically. An exact theoretical basis for the analogies follows from the equivalence between classical and quantal `lattice gases' and the Ising and Heisenberg-Ising magnetic models. General rigorous inequalities for critical exponents at and below Tc are derived. The nature and validity of the `classical' (phenomenological and mean field) theories are discussed, their predictions being contrasted with the exact results for plane Ising models, which are summarized concisely. Padé approximant and ratio techniques applied to appropriate series expansions lead to precise critical-point estimates for the three-dimensional Heisenberg and Ising models (tables of data are presented). With this background a critique is presented of recent theoretical ideas: namely, the `droplet' picture of the critical point and the `homogeneity' and `scaling' hypotheses. These lead to a `law of corresponding states' near a critical point and to relations between the various exponents which suggest that perhaps only two or three exponents might be algebraically independent for any system.},

The key difficulty in articulating this relationship is that shape is an inexhaustible parameter, making its systematic exploration infeasible. Here we show that the role of particle shape can, however, be explored efficiently when granular design is viewed in the context of artificial evolution. By introducing a mutable representation for particle shapes, we demonstrate with computer simulation how shapes can be evolved. As proof of principle, we predicted motifs that link shape to packing stiffness, discovered a particle that produces aggregates that stiffen—rather than weaken—under compression, and verified the results using three-dimensional printing. More generally, our approach facilitates the exploration of the role of arbitrary particle geometry in jammed systems, and invites the discovery and design of granular matter with optimized properties.},

The bead-spring and bead-rod models are presented, the range of their applicability discussed, and methods presented for inclusion of hydrodynamics interactions, excluded volume, and other physical effects within {BD} simulations. After reviewing and updating work in the linear viscoelastic regime, the primary focus shifts to the more complex nonlinear regime. While {BD} predictions of the conformations of 20 to 100 micron long {DNA} molecules in strong shear and extensional flows has been in good to excellent agreement with the corresponding experiments, predictions of the polystyrene dilute solutionrheometry data have been hit or miss, with poorer results obtained for the higher molecular weights. This may be due, in part, to the more important roles of hydrodynamic interactions and excluded volume interactions in the more flexible, and therefore more condensed, polystyrene coils. Inclusion of these effects in {BD} simulations has led to improved predictions, but does not lead to the accurate prediction of the plateau Trouton viscosity for higher molecular weight samples, nor alleviate the complete failure of simulations to predict measurements of coil distortion by light scattering. Thus, despite enormous progress in the past decade, some significant gaps in understanding remain.},

At low forces the deformation of dextran was found to be dominated by entropic forces and can be described by the Langevin function with a 6 angstrom Kuhn length. At elevated forces the strand elongation was governed by a twist of bond angles. At higher forces the dextran filaments underwent a distinct conformational change. The polymer stiffened and the segment elasticity was dominated by the bending of bond angles. The conformational change was found to be reversible and was corroborated by molecular dynamics calculations.},

	abstract = {Applications for porous fibrous materials range from electrochemical substrates to web reinforcement in polymeric composite materials. The details of local load transfer are studied in a class of cost-effective, stochastic fibrous networks used in battery applications, which form the substrate for a composite electrode. The connectivity of these materials is quantitatively related to modulus and strength, and detailed results of different simulations approaches in approximating material construction are discussed. In Part I, we discuss microscale assumptions, including beam type, nodal connections and equivalence of models to more physically realistic models. Simulation of large networks is computationally intensive, and show low-strain, nonlinear behavior even when comprised of elastic elements when failure criteria (here, strength-of-materials) are applied to produce sequential rupture of beams and nodes. Strategies for effective simulation of these materials requires detailed analysis of the simplest assumptions which can be made at the microscale which produce acceptably realistic response. We show that simple Euler-Bernoulli beam elements can be used to effectively model such materials, even when segment lengths in a network are very small. Moreover, connections comprised of simple torsion springs produce realistic behavior, and can mimic more realistic junctures by adaptation of the linear solution to a compliant zone model. In Part {II} of this work, we demonstrate the effect of model selection on full network behavior, and also discuss issues of connectivity at the scale of the porous material rather than element-by-element. This work points toward use of simple constructions to model complex behavior, and may ultimately provide insight into modeling of a large class of porous materials. [S0094-4289(00)01704-7]},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock–paper–scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.},

	abstract = {We present a study of exclusion processes on networks as models for complex transport phenomena, and in particular for active transport of motor proteins along the cytoskeleton. Specifically, we focus on the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ({TASEP)} as well as its generalizations including backstepping (partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ({PASEP))} and exchange with a bulk concentration ({TASEP} with Langmuir kinetics ({TASEP-LK)).} We build on the previously used effective rate approach to establish a general methodology in terms of effective rate diagrams, which allows for a simple classification of the stationary transport state of the total network. This approach is general and reveals generic features of exclusion processes on networks. Based on the three examples considered here, we show that the classification can be made in terms of three qualitative different network regimes: a homogeneous regime, a heterogeneous network regime and a heterogeneous segment regime. Using parameters representative of real motor proteins, we show how the transitions between these regimes can be regulated through a variety of multi-scale factors, such as the interplay of exclusion interactions, the non-equilibrium nature of the transport process, motor processivity and the network topology. Using the equilibrium limits of {PASEP} and {TASEP-LK}, we also shed further light on the emergence of density heterogeneities in active transport phenomena.},

In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions, one from each alternative way. The probability that a particle will be found to have a path x(t) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of ℏ) for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching x, t from the past is the wave function ψ(x, t). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated, in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics.},

	abstract = {A goal of complex system research is to identify the dynamical implications of network structure. While early results focused mainly on local or global structural properties, there is now growing interest in mesoscale structures that comprise more than one node but not the whole network. A central challenge is to discover under what conditions the occurrence of a specific mesoscale motif already allows conclusions on the dynamics of a network as a whole. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of ecological food webs, complex heterogeneous networks of interacting populations. Generalizing the results of {MacArthur} and Sánchez-García (2009 Phys. Rev. E 80 26117), we show that certain mesoscale symmetries imply the existence of localized dynamical modes. If these modes are unstable the occurrence of the corresponding mesoscale motif implies dynamical instability regardless of the structure of the embedding network. In contrast, if the mode is stable it means that the symmetry can be exploited to reduce the number of nodes in the model, without changing the dynamics of the system. This result explains a previously observed dynamical equivalence between food webs containing a different number of species.},

One such open puzzle is the observed pulses of backward-moving myosin-X in the filopodia structure. Motivated by this phenomenon we introduce two generalizations of the ‘total asymmetric exclusion process’ ({TASEP)} that might be relevant to the formation of such pulses. The first is adding a nearest-neighbours attractive interaction between motors, while the second is adding an internal degree of freedom corresponding to a processive and immobile form of the motors. Switching between the two states occurs stochastically, without a conservation law. Both models show strong deviations from the mean field behaviour and lack particle–hole symmetry. We use approximations borrowed from the research on vehicular traffic models to calculate the current and jam size distribution in a system with periodic boundary conditions and introduce a novel modification to one of these approximation schemes.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed the key role of natively unfolded proteins in many important biological processes. In order to study the conformational changes of these proteins, a one-bead-per-amino-acid coarse grained ({CG)} model is developed, and a method is proposed to extract the potential functions for the local interactions between {CG} beads. Experimentally obtained Ramachandran data for the coil regions of proteins are converted into distributions of pseudo-bond and pseudo-dihedral angles between neighboring alpha-carbons in the polypeptide chain. These are then used to derive bending and torsion potentials, which are residue and sequence specific. The validity of the developed model is testified by studying the radius of gyration as well as the hydrodynamic properties of chemically denatured proteins.},

The second example considers polymer nanocomposites; a review of recent simulations is presented, with an emphasis on the description of entanglements in such systems and new methods for the study of the segregation of nanoparticles that arises in copolymers, in which composition heterogeneity can be used to control nanoparticle position and develop an increased understanding of nanoparticle-polymer interactions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0502024.pdf},
	abstract = {Measuring, characterizing and modelling the slow dynamics of glassy soft matter is a
great challenge, with an impact that ranges from industrial applications to fundamental
issues in modern statistical physics, such as the glass transition and the description of
out-of-equilibrium systems. Although our understanding of these phenomena is still far
from complete, recent simulations and novel theoretical approaches and experimental
methods have shed new light on the dynamics of soft glassy materials. In this paper,
we review the work of the last few years, with an emphasis on experiments in four
distinct and yet related areas: the existence of two different glass states (attractive
and repulsive), the dynamics of systems very far from equilibrium, the effect of an
external perturbation on glassy materials, and dynamical heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {As the structural backbone of blood clots, fibrin networks carry out the mechanical task of stemming blood flow at sites of vascular injury. These networks exhibit a rich set of remarkable mechanical properties, but a detailed picture relating the microscopic mechanics of the individual fibers to the overall network properties has not been fully developed. In particular, how the high strain and failure characteristics of single fibers affect the overall strength of the network is not known. Using a combined fluorescence/atomic force microscope nanomanipulation system, we stretched 2-D fibrin networks to the point of failure, while recording the strain of individual fibers. Our results were compared to a pair of model networks: one composed of linearly responding elements and a second of nonlinear, strain-stiffening elements. We find that strain-stiffening of the individual fibers is necessary to explain the pattern of strain propagation throughout the network that we observe in our experiments. Fiber strain-stiffening acts to distribute strain more equitably within the network, reduce strain maxima, and increase network strength. Along with its physiological implications, a detailed understanding of this strengthening mechanism may lead to new design strategies for engineered polymeric materials.},

At low linker concentrations the solution forms an isotropic gel phase. At higher linker concentrations we encounter —depending on the properties of the linker molecules— bundle phases, liquid-crystalline mesophases with broken bond-orientational order that had been predicted by analytical theories, and in addition a novel equilibrium state: the cluster phase. Equilibrium condensation of semi-flexible polymers appears to be controlled by linker entropy. The results are compared with the phase behavior of solutions of biopolymers and linker proteins.},

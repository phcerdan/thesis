  abstract	= {One of the most frequently used notions of "structured
		  sparsity" is that of sparse (discrete) gradients, a
		  structure typically elicited through
		  $\backslash$emph\{Total-Variation (TV)\} regularizers. This
		  paper focuses on anisotropic TV-regularizers, in particular
		  on \$$\backslash$ell\_p\$-norm $\backslash$emph\{weighted
		  TV regularizers\} for which it develops efficient
		  algorithms to compute the corresponding proximity
		  operators. Our algorithms enable one to scalably
		  incorporate TV regularization of vector, matrix, or tensor
		  data into a proximal convex optimization solvers. For the
		  special case of vectors, we derive and implement a highly
		  efficient weighted 1D-TV solver. This solver provides a
		  backbone for subsequently handling the more complex task of
		  higher-dimensional (two or more) TV by means of a modular
		  proximal optimization approach. We present numerical
		  experiments that demonstrate how our 1D-TV solver matches
		  or exceeds the best known 1D-TV solvers. Thereafter, we
		  illustrate the benefits of our modular design through
		  extensive experiments on: (i) image denoising; (ii) image
		  deconvolution; and (iii) four variants of fused-lasso. Our
		  results show the flexibility and speed our TV solvers offer
		  over competing approaches. To underscore our claims, we
		  provide our TV solvers in an easy to use multi-threaded C++
		  library (which also aids reproducibility of our results).},

		  ({TEs)} plays a critical role in determining the mechanical
		  properties thereof. One of the key challenges in
		  constitutive modeling of {TEs} is incorporating the
		  kinematics at both the macroscopic and the microscopic
		  scale. Models of fibrous microstructure commonly assume
		  fibrils to move homogeneously, that is affine with the
		  macroscopic deformation. While intuitive for situations of
		  fibril-matrix load transfer, the relevance of the affine
		  assumption is less clear when primary load transfer is from
		  fibril to fibril. The microstructure of {TEs} is a hydrated
		  network of collagen fibrils, making its microstructural
		  kinematics an open question. Numerical simulation of
		  uniaxial extensile behavior in planar {TE} networks was
		  performed with fibril kinematics dictated by the network
		  model and by the affine model. The average fibril
		  orientation evolved similarly with strain for both models.
		  The individual fibril kinematics, however, were markedly
		  different. There was no correlation between fibril strain
		  and orientation in the network model, and fibril strains
		  were contained by extensive reorientation. As a result, the
		  macroscopic stress given by the network model was roughly
		  threefold lower than the affine model. Also, the network
		  model showed a toe region, where fibril reorientation
		  precluded the development of significant fibril strain. We
		  conclude that network fibril kinematics are not governed by
		  affine principles, an important consideration in the
		  understanding of tissue and {TE} mechanics, especially when
		  load bearing is primarily by an interconnected fibril
		  network.},

		  polymer, demethylesterified by pectin methylesterase
		  enzymes and cross-linked by calcium ions to form a gel.
		  However, this idea is based largely on indirect evidence
		  and in vitro studies. We took advantage of the wall
		  architecture of the unicellular alga Penium margaritaceum,
		  which forms an elaborate calcium cross-linked HG-rich
		  lattice on its cell surface, to test this model and other
		  aspects of pectin dynamics. Studies of live cells and

		  degree of methylesterification and sufficient levels of
		  calcium are critical for lattice formation in vivo.
		  Pectinase treatments of live cells and immunological
		  studies suggested the presence of another class of pectin
		  polymer, rhamnogalacturonan I, and indicated its
		  colocalization and structural association with HG.
		  Carbohydrate microarray analysis of the walls of P.
		  margaritaceum, Physcomitrella patens, and Arabidopsis
		  (Arabidopsis thaliana) further suggested the conservation
		  of pectin organization and interpolymer associations in the

		  those of embryophytes. The HG-rich lattice of P.
		  margaritaceum, a member of the charophyte green algae, the

		  important for cell adhesion. Therefore, the calcium-HG gel

  abstract	= {In this report we review the fundamentals, applications
		  and future tendencies of dynamic atomic force microscopy
		  ({AFM)} methods. Our focus is on understanding why the
		  changes observed in the dynamic properties of a vibrating
		  tip that interacts with a surface make possible to obtain
		  molecular resolution images of membrane proteins in aqueous
		  solutions or to resolve atomic-scale surface defects in
		  ultra high vacuum ({UHV).} Our description of the two major
		  dynamic {AFM} modes, amplitude modulation atomic force
		  microscopy ({AM-AFM)} and frequency modulation atomic force
		  microscopy ({FM-AFM)} emphasises their common points
		  without ignoring the differences in experimental set-ups
		  and operating conditions. Those differences are introduced
		  by the different feedback parameters, oscillation amplitude
		  in {AM-AFM} and frequency shift and excitation amplitude in
		  {FM-AFM}, used to track the topography and composition of a
		  surface.
		  
		  The theoretical analysis of {AM-AFM} (also known as
		  tapping-mode) emphasises the coexistence, in many
		  situations of interests, of two stable oscillation states,
		  a low and high amplitude solution. The coexistence of those
		  oscillation states is a consequence of the presence of
		  attractive and repulsive components in the interaction
		  force and their non-linear dependence on the tip–surface
		  separation. We show that key relevant experimental
		  properties such as the lateral resolution, image contrast
		  and sample deformation are highly dependent on the
		  oscillation state chosen to operate the instrument.
		  {AM-AFM} allows to obtain simultaneous topographic and
		  compositional contrast in heterogeneous samples by
		  recording the phase angle difference between the external
		  excitation and the tip motion (phase imaging). Significant
		  applications of {AM-AFM} such as high-resolution imaging of
		  biomolecules and polymers, large-scale patterning of
		  silicon surfaces, manipulation of single nanoparticles or
		  the fabrication of single electron devices are also
		  reviewed.
		  
		  {FM-AFM} (also called non-contact {AFM—NC-AFM)} has
		  achieved the long-standing goal of true atomic resolution
		  with {AFM} in {UHV.} Our analysis starts with a discussion
		  of the relation between frequency shifts and tip–surface
		  interactions, emphasising the ability of perturbation
		  theory to describe the measured frequency shift. We discuss
		  the role of short-range chemical interactions in the atomic
		  contrast, with particular attention to semiconductor and
		  ionic (alkali halides and oxides) surfaces. Also included
		  is a detailed quantitative comparison between theoretical
		  simulations and experiment. Inversion procedures, the
		  determination of the tip–sample interaction from the
		  frequency shift versus distance curves above specific
		  sites, are also reviewed. We finish with a discussion of
		  the optimal range of experimental operation parameters, and
		  the use of damping (excitation amplitude) as a source of
		  atomic contrast, including the possible interpretation in
		  terms of microscopic dissipation mechanisms.},

  abstract	= {Dynamic oscillatory shear tests are common in rheology and
		  have been used to investigate a wide range of soft matter
		  and complex fluids including polymer melts and solutions,
		  block copolymers, biological macromolecules,
		  polyelectrolytes, surfactants, suspensions, emulsions and
		  beyond. More specifically, small amplitude oscillatory
		  shear ({SAOS)} tests have become the canonical method for
		  probing the linear viscoelastic properties of these complex
		  fluids because of the firm theoretical background [1–4]
		  and the ease of implementing suitable test protocols.
		  However, in most processing operations the deformations can
		  be large and rapid: it is therefore the nonlinear material
		  properties that control the system response. A full sample
		  characterization thus requires well-defined nonlinear test
		  protocols. Consequently there has been a recent renewal of
		  interest in exploiting large amplitude oscillatory shear
		  ({LAOS)} tests to investigate and quantify the nonlinear
		  viscoelastic behavior of complex fluids. In terms of the
		  experimental input, both {LAOS} and {SAOS} require the user
		  to select appropriate ranges of strain amplitude (γ0) and
		  frequency (ω). However, there is a distinct difference in
		  the analysis of experimental output, i.e. the material
		  response. At sufficiently large strain amplitude, the
		  material response will become nonlinear in {LAOS} tests and
		  the familiar material functions used to quantify the linear
		  behavior in {SAOS} tests are no longer sufficient. For
		  example, the definitions of the linear viscoelastic moduli
		  G′(ω) and G″(ω) are based inherently on the
		  assumption that the stress response is purely sinusoidal
		  (linear). However, a nonlinear stress response is not a
		  perfect sinusoid and therefore the viscoelastic moduli are
		  not uniquely defined; other methods are needed for
		  quantifying the nonlinear material response under {LAOS}
		  deformation. In the present review article, we first
		  summarize the typical nonlinear responses observed with
		  complex fluids under {LAOS} deformations. We then introduce
		  and critically compare several methods that quantify the
		  nonlinear oscillatory stress response. We illustrate the
		  utility and sensitivity of these protocols by investigating
		  the nonlinear response of various complex fluids over a
		  wide range of frequency and amplitude of deformation, and
		  show that {LAOS} characterization is a rigorous test for
		  rheological models and advanced quality control.},

  abstract	= {Fibrin gels are biological networks that play a
		  fundamental role in blood coagulation and other
		  patho/physiological processes, such as thrombosis and

		  collection of fibers that are relatively monodisperse in
		  diameter, not uniformly distributed, and connected at nodal
		  points with a branching order of $\sim$3\textendash{}4.
		  Although in the confocal images the hydrated fibers appear
		  to be quite straight (mass fractal dimension Dm~= 1), for
		  the overall system 1$<$Dm$<$2. Based on the confocal
		  images, we developed a method to generate three-dimensional
		  (3D) in~silico gels made of cylindrical sticks of diameter
		  d, density $\rho$, and average length 〈L〉, joined at
		  randomly distributed nodal points. The resulting 3D network
		  strikingly resembles real fibrin gels and can be sketched
		  as an assembly of densely packed fractal blobs, i.e.,
		  regions of size $\xi$, where the fiber concentration is
		  higher than average. The blobs are placed at a distance
		  $\xi$0 between their centers of mass so that they are
		  overlapped by a factor $\eta$~= $\xi$/$\xi$0 and have Dm
		  $\sim$1.2\textendash{}1.6. The in~silico gels' structure is
		  quantitatively analyzed by its 3D spatial correlation
		  function g3D(r) and corresponding power spectrum I(q)~=
		  FFT3D[g3D(r)], from which $\rho$,~d, Dm, $\eta$, and $\xi$0
		  can be extracted. In particular, $\xi$0 provides an
		  excellent estimate of the gel mesh size. The in~silico
		  gels' I(q) compares quite well with real gels' elastic
		  light-scattering measurements. We then derived an
		  analytical form factor for accurately fitting the
		  scattering data, which allowed us to directly recover the

		  polysaccharide molecules have recently expanded

		  transitions between the chair and boat conformers of the
		  pyranose ring structure. We now expand these observations
		  to include chair inversion, a common phenomenon in the
		  conformational chemistry of six-membered ring molecules. We
		  demonstrate that by stretching single pectin molecules (1
		  → 4-linked α-d-galactouronic acid polymer), we could
		  change the pyranose ring conformation from a chair to a
		  boat and then to an inverted chair in a clearly resolved
		  two-step conversion: {4C1} ⇄ boat ⇄ {1C4.} The two-step
		  extension of the distance between the glycosidic oxygen
		  atoms O1 and O4 determined by atomic force microscope
		  manipulations is corroborated by ab initio calculations of
		  the increase in length of the residue vector {O1O4} on
		  chair inversion. We postulate that this conformational
		  change results from the torque generated by the glycosidic
		  bonds when a force is applied to the pectin molecule.
		  Hence, the glycosidic bonds act as mechanical levers,
		  driving the conformational transitions of the pyranose
		  ring. When the glycosidic bonds are equatorial (e), the
		  torque is zero, causing no conformational change. However,
		  when the glycosidic bond is axial (a), torque is generated,
		  causing a rotation around {C—C} bonds and a
		  conformational change. This hypothesis readily predicts the
		  number of transitions observed in pyranose monomers with
		  1a-4a linkages (two), 1a-4e (one), and 1e-4e (none). Our
		  results demonstrate single-molecule mechanochemistry with
		  the capability of resolving complex conformational

		  essential to their physiological function and cannot easily
		  be duplicated by synthetic materials. Unlike simple polymer
		  gels, many biological materials—including blood vessels,
		  mesentery tissue, lung parenchyma, cornea and blood
		  clots—stiffen as they are strained, thereby preventing
		  large deformations that could threaten tissue integrity.
		  The molecular structures and design principles responsible
		  for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a
		  molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a
		  range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal
		  and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal
		  stress–strain relations at low to intermediate strains.
		  The input to this theory is the force–extension curve for
		  individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that
		  biological networks composed of these filaments are
		  homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly.
		  This theory shows that systems of filamentous proteins
		  arranged in an open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen at
		  low strains without requiring a specific architecture or
		  multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffness.},

  abstract	= {Force-extension (F-x) relationships were measured for
		  single molecules of {DNA} under a variety of buffer
		  conditions, using an optical trapping interferometer
		  modified to incorporate feedback control. One end of a
		  single {DNA} molecule was fixed to a coverglass surface by
		  means of a stalled {RNA} polymerase complex. The other end
		  was linked to a microscopic bead, which was captured and
		  held in an optical trap. The {DNA} was subsequently
		  stretched by moving the coverglass with respect to the trap
		  using a piezo-driven stage, while the position of the bead
		  was recorded at nanometer-scale resolution. An electronic
		  feedback circuit was activated to prevent bead movement
		  beyond a preset clamping point by modulating the light
		  intensity, altering the trap stiffness dynamically. This
		  arrangement permits rapid determination of the F-x
		  relationship for individual {DNA} molecules as short as -1
		  micron with unprecedented accuracy, subjected to both low
		  (approximately 0.1 {pN)} and high (approximately 50 {pN)}
		  loads: complete data sets are acquired in under a minute.
		  Experimental F-x relationships were fit over much of their
		  range by entropic elasticity theories based on worm-like
		  chain models. Fits yielded a persistence length, Lp, of
		  approximately 47 nm in a buffer containing 10 {mM} Na1.
		  Multivalent cations, such as Mg2+ or spermidine 3+, reduced
		  Lp to approximately 40 nm. Although multivalent ions shield
		  most of the negative charges on the {DNA} backbone, they
		  did not further reduce Lp significantly, suggesting that
		  the intrinsic persistence length remains close to 40 nm. An
		  elasticity theory incorporating both enthalpic and entropic
		  contributions to stiffness fit the experimental results
		  extremely well throughout the full range of extensions and
		  returned an elastic modulus of approximately 1100 {pN.}},

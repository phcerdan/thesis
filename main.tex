  The aim of this work is to extract the architecture of biopolymer networks from 3D images.
  This is motivated to further understand non-affine regimes, found in growing network formation and low-density biopolymer networks, where the geometry of network have a fundamental role in its mechanical properties.

  Firstly, developed image analysis tools were extended to 3D and contributed to high-performance open-source libraries for image analysis. These developments in isotropic wavelets will aid to extract a realistic network, removing spurious noise generated from image acquisition.

  Secondly, proved that images from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), can be used to reliably extract the network architecture. The imaged material was also studied with small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and the comparison showed a strong agreement for network-size features.

  Thirdly, spatial graphs were extracted from the image. We provided a one-to-one map between
  image and graph, keeping all the geometric information from the image. This allow using analytical tools from the complex networks field to characterize images.

  Finally, statistical distributions extracted from three graph properties were used to reconstruct a completely in-silico network using a simulated annealing technique to generate new networks.
  This can be used as an exploration tool of network behavior under different network architectures.

% Finally, from these physical networks we will infer statistical distributions of
% parameters that characterize the network, such as the length distribution
% between nodes (cross-links), the number of branches from each node, the angle
% distribution between those branches or the distribution of network clusters.
% From this statistical distribution, using the software developed in-house, we
% will be able to reconstruct a network in-silico, with the same
% characteristics as the original physical network studied with image analysis.

  %create a link between image analysis and complex networks
%   TODO TODO TODO link with conclusions and motivation in intro.
% In particular this thesis focuses in bio-polymers, that are polymers produced
% by living organisms, as peptides (proteins), nucleic acids (DNA), and sugars.
%
% The structure of it will be:
% First, analysis of images from tomography electro microscopy (TEM) or confocal
% Microscopy of biopolymers show us the architecture of the underlying network.
% A spatial graph will be derived from this analysis, and the
% physical network characterized.
%
% Secondly, from this physical networks we will infer statistical distribution of
% parameters that characterize the network, such as the length distribution
% between nodes (cross-links), the number of branches from each node, the angle
% distribution between those branches or the network clusters distribution.
% From this statistical distribution, using the developed software, we will be
% able to reconstruct in-silico the network, with the same characteristics than
% the original physical network studied with image analysis.
%
% Thirdly, our group has the expertise, using optical traps, to measure
% force elongation curves of a single polymer chain. Following a bottom-up
% approach with this single-chain energy function on the one hand and the network
% architecture at the other, we will compute different bulk properties of
% the polymeric material.
% Then we will compare these simulated results to experiments in the macro-scale.
% A well known bulk parameter is the complex shear modulus (G*), which is
% accessible via rheometry techniques.
%
% Finally, a simulation of the dynamics of the network will be pursued. The long
% time dynamics of these biopolymer networks are not captured by the current
% theoretical framework. A hypothesis associate them to the breakage of
% cross-links and the release of chain constraints. There are multitude approaches
% of the dynamics,

% First, the field of soft matter is introduced, along with the main
% characteristics of semi-flexible polymers.  Then we will scale up
% from single biopolymer chains to networks and their associated stress-strain
% measurements.
%
% In the second chapter: analysis of images from
% transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tomography or confocal microscopy of
% biopolymer gels show us the architecture of underlying networks.
% Spatial graphs will be derived from this analysis, and
% physical networks characterized.
%
% Thirdly, from these physical networks we will infer statistical distributions of
% parameters that characterize the network, such as the length distribution
% between nodes (cross-links), the number of branches from each node, the angle
% distribution between those branches or the distribution of network clusters.
% From this statistical distribution, using the software developed in-house, we
% will be able to reconstruct a network in-silico, with the same
% characteristics as the original physical network studied with image analysis.
%
% Finally, I will comment about my collaboration in the ``Mesocule project'',
% future directions and about the schedule of short and long-term goals of the
% thesis.
%
% \textbf{RESEARCH QUESTIONS:}
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item How do we use data obtained from modern imaging techniques to
%   reconstruct biopolymer networks in-silico?
%   \item How do we use these reconstructions to model the physical properties of
%   biopolymer networks?

A special thank to my supervisor Bill Williams whose support, openness, and
vision of science is encouraging. As Brad would say,
I will be forever indebted to your supervision and I add: and from all the stuff that I have learned from you beyond academia, specially your humane values and the love for dumplings. Thanks to Brad Mansel, Leif Lundin and Andrew Leis for the collaboration comparing scattering and imaging techniques, and to all my group mates from the \groupname{}, for all the shared moments, and how easy they made my adaptation to a new country.  Finally, I am grateful to the \macdiarmid{} for constantly
providing the enrichment opportunity to meet other peer students and
researchers, and to the staff of the Institute of Fundamental Sciences for its kindness dealing with all sort of issues.

In the personal side, I would like to thank my family, from who I have inherited, directly and indirectly, principles I stand for and made me realize how privileged I am to have them.
And Martica! Without you here in New Zealand this quest would have been impossible, or faster, who knows, but way less enjoyable for sure. It has been a pleasure habernos re-encontrado por kiwi-land. And even we got married, in english!!, crazy, but made me feel extremely fortunate. Thanks really for all your support.

This research was supported by the MacDiarmid Institute, the Riddet Institute, and Massey University,
New Zealand. }

  abstract = {In an earlier paper written for a different readership [Computers and Graphics 13(2) (1989) 159\textendash{}166] the first author defined a digital fundamental group\textemdash{}an analog, for binary digital pictures, of the fundamental group. In general the definition of the digital fundamental group involves continuous deformation. But an alternative, discrete, definition of the digital fundamental group was proposed for the strongly normal digital picture spaces defined in the same paper. The above-mentioned paper also defined a ``continuous analog'' C(P) for each binary digital picture P on such a DPS (DPS=digital picture space). C(P) is a polyhedron constructed by ``filling in the gaps'' between black points (1's) of the binary digital picture P in a specific way. Other kinds of continuous analog had previously been used by the first two authors. In seeking the simplest and most efficient algorithms for performing image processing operations, researchers have considered many different combinations of grids and adjacency relations. Almost all of those combinations are isomorphic to special cases of the concept of a strongly normal DPS. The main contribution of the present paper is a proof that the digital fundamental groups of binary digital pictures on a strongly normal DPS are naturally isomorphic to the fundamental groups of the digital pictures' continuous analogs. We use this result to establish that on a strongly normal DPS the discrete and continuous definitions of the digital fundamental group are equivalent, up to a natural group isomorphism. We also show that many topological results which hold in the Euclidean plane or Euclidean 3-space have analogs that hold in every strongly normal DPS. Our results suggest that a strongly normal DPS is a suitable domain for studying topology-related image processing operations such as thinning, border tracking and contour filling. The definitions of digital fundamental group, strongly normal DPS and continuous analog are included in this paper so as to make it self-contained.},

This structural contribution was determined from the relationships between the global viscoelastic properties of the tensegrity model, i.e., normalized viscosity modulus ($\eta$*), normalized elasticity modulus (E*), and the physical properties of the constitutive elements, i.e., their normalized length (L*) and normalized initial internal tension (T*). We used a numerical method to simulate the deformation of the structure in response to different types of loading, while varying by several orders of magnitude L* and T*. The numerical results obtained reveal that $\eta$* remains almost independent of changes in T* ($\eta$*$\propto$T*+0.1), whereas E* increases with approximately the square root of the internal tension T* (from E*$\propto$T*+0.3 to E*$\propto$T*+0.7). Moreover, structural viscosity $\eta$* and elasticity E* are both inversely proportional to the square of the size of the structure ($\eta$*$\propto$L*-2 and E*$\propto$L*-2). These structural properties appear consistent with cytoskeleton (CSK) mechanical properties measured experimentally by various methods which are specific to the CSK micromanipulation in living adherent cells. Present results suggest, for the first time, that the effect of structural rearrangement of CSK elements on global CSK behavior is characterized by a faster cellular mechanical response relatively to the CSK element response, which thus contributes to the solidification process observed in adherent cells. In extending to the viscoelastic properties the analysis of the mechanical response of the cellular 30-element tensegrity model, the present study contributes to the understanding of recent results on the cellular-dynamic response and allows to reunify the scattered data reported for the viscoelastic properties of living adherent cells.},

MD can very well simulate the atomistic behavior, but cannot simulate macroscale length and time due to computational limits. FE can very well simulate continuum mechanics (CM) problems, but has the limitation of the lack of atomistic level degrees of freedom. Multiscale modeling is an expedient methodology with a potential to connect different levels of modeling such as quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and continuum mechanics. This study proposes a new multiscale modeling technique to couple MD with FE. The proposed method relies on weighted average momentum principle. A wave propagation example has been used to illustrate the challenges in coupling MD with FE and to verify the proposed technique. Furthermore, 2-Dimensional problem has also been used to demonstrate how this method would translate into real world applications.},

The Tevatron data strongly suggests that one-loop computations in QCD describe hard scattering well. Extrapolating this observation to the LHC, we conclude that knowledge of many short-distance processes at next-to-leading order may be required to describe the physics of hard scattering. While the field of one-loop computations is quite mature, parton multiplicities in hard LHC events are so high that traditional computational techniques become inefficient. Recently new approaches based on unitarity have been developed for calculating one-loop scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. These methods are especially suitable for the description of multi-particle processes in QCD and are amenable to numerical implementations. We present a systematic pedagogical description of both conceptual and technical aspects of the new methods.},

Fractal analysis based on the spectral dimension is used, for the first time, to characterise fibrin gel microstructure in terms of the internal connectivity of gel networks. A significant correlation is found between the fractal characteristics of the incipient gel network and its eventual mature form, confirming that incipient gel microstructure templates ensuing gel development. We report an analytical basis for the study of this templating effect which reveals two different regimes of microstructural development. The first involves low thrombin concentration, in which increasing concentration decreases the gel formation time and alters the fractal characteristics of both incipient and mature gels. In the second regime, involving higher thrombin concentrations, the incipient gel formation time and the fractal characteristics of incipient and mature gels show little variation. The network formation is discussed in terms of computer simulations of incipient fractal networks by the activation-limited aggregation of clusters of rod-like particles. The significance of the work is discussed in terms of biomaterials design for applications involving controlled drug release and wound healing, and improved predictions of blood clot susceptibility to lysis.},

We combine a smooth vessel filter which is based on a geometrical analysis of the Hessian's eigensystem, with a non-linear anisotropic diffusion scheme. The amount and orientation of diffusion depend on the local vessel likeliness. Vessel enhancing diffusion (VED) is applied to patient and phantom data and compared to linear, regularized Perona\textendash{}Malik, edge and coherence enhancing diffusion. The method performs better than most of the existing techniques in visualizing vessels with varying radii and in enhancing vessel appearance. A diameter study on phantom data shows that VED least affects the accuracy of diameter measurements. It is shown that using VED as a preprocessing step improves level set based segmentation of the cerebral vasculature, in particular segmentation of the smaller vessels of the vasculature.},

If there is a second sample, y1,$\cdots$,yMy\_1, $\backslash$cdots, y\_M, a test of the hypothesis that the two samples come from the same (unspecified) continuous distribution can be based on the analogue of N$\omega$2N$\backslash$omega\^2, namely T=[NM/(N+M)]$\int\infty$-$\infty$[FN(x)-GM(x)]2dHN+M(x),(2)$\backslash$begin\{equation*\}$\backslash$tag\{2\} T = $\backslash$lbrack NM/(N + M)$\backslash$rbrack $\backslash$int\^$\backslash$infty\_\{-$\backslash$infty\} $\backslash$lbrack F\_N(x) - G\_M(x)$\backslash$rbrack\^2 dH\_\{N+M\}(x),$\backslash$end\{equation*\} where GM(x)G\_M(x) is the empirical distribution function of the second sample and HN+M(x)H\_\{N+M\}(x) is the empirical distribution function of the two samples together [that is, (N+M)HN+M(x)=NFN(x)+MGM(x)](N + M)H\_\{N+M\}(x) = NF\_N(x) + MG\_M(x)$\backslash$rbrack. The limiting distribution of N$\omega$2N$\backslash$omega\^2 as N$\rightarrow\infty$N $\backslash$rightarrow $\backslash$infty has been tabulated [2], and it has been shown ([3], [4a], and [7]) that TT has the same limiting distribution as N$\rightarrow\infty$,M$\rightarrow\infty$N $\backslash$rightarrow $\backslash$infty, M $\backslash$rightarrow $\backslash$infty, and N/M$\rightarrow\lambda$N/M $\backslash$rightarrow $\backslash$lambda, where $\lambda\backslash$lambda is any finite positive constant. In this note we consider the distribution of TT for small values of NN and MM and present tables to permit use of the criterion at some conventional significance levels for small values of NN and MM. The limiting distribution seems a surprisingly good approximation to the exact distribution for moderate sample sizes (corresponding to the same feature for N$\omega$2N$\backslash$omega\^2 [6]). The accuracy of approximation is better than in the case of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic studied by Hodges [4].},

  abstract = {In an attempt to understand the role of structural rearrangement onto the cell response during imposed cyclic stresses, we simulated numerically the frequency-dependent behavior of a viscoelastic tensegrity structure (VTS model) made of 24 elastic cables and 6 rigid bars. The VTS computational model was based on the nonsmooth contact dynamics (NSCD) method in which the constitutive elements of the tensegrity structure are considered as a set of material points that mutually interact. Low amplitude oscillatory loading conditions were applied and the frequency response of the overall structure was studied in terms of frequency dependence of mechanical properties. The latter were normalized by the homogeneous properties of constitutive elements in order to capture the essential feature of spatial rearrangement. The results reveal a specific frequency-dependent contribution of elastic and viscous effects which is responsible for significant changes in the VTS model dynamical properties. The mechanism behind is related to the variable contribution of spatial rearrangement of VTS elements which is decreased from low to high frequency as dominant effects are transferred from mainly elastic to mainly viscous. More precisely, the elasticity modulus increases with frequency while the viscosity modulus decreases, each evolution corresponding to a specific power-law dependency. The satisfactorily agreement found between present numerical results and the literature data issued from in vitro cell experiments suggests that the frequency-dependent mechanism of spatial rearrangement presently described could play a significant and predictable role during oscillatory cell dynamics.},

  abstract = {A technique called distance-ordered homotopic thinning (DOHT) for skeletonizing 3D binary images is presented. DOHT produces skeletons that are homotopic, thin, and medial. This is achieved by sequentially deleting points in ascending distance order until no more can be safely deleted. A point can be safely deleted only if doing so preserves topology. Distance information is provided by the chamfer distance transform, an integer approximation to the Euclidean distance transform. Two variations of DOHT are presented that arise from using different rules for preserving points. The first uses explicit rules for preserving the ends of medial axes or edges of medial surfaces, and the second preserves the centers of maximal balls identified from the chamfer distance transform. By thresholding the centers according to their distance values, the user can control the scale of features represented in the skeleton. Results are presented for real and synthetic 2D and 3D data.},

  abstract = {Embodiment has led to a revolution in robotics by not thinking of the robot body and its controller as two separate units, but taking into account the interaction of the body with its environment. By investigating the effect of the body on the overall control computation, it has been suggested that the body is effectively performing computations, leading to the term morphological computation. Recent work has linked this to the field of reservoir computing, allowing one to endow morphologies with a theory of universal computation. In this work, we study a family of highly dynamic body structures, called tensegrity structures, controlled by one of the simplest kinds of "brains." These structures can be used to model biomechanical systems at different scales. By analyzing this extreme instantiation of compliant structures, we demonstrate the existence of a spectrum of choices of how to implement control in the body-brain composite. We show that tensegrity structures can maintain complex gaits with linear feedback control and that external feedback can intrinsically be integrated in the control loop. The various linear learning rules we consider differ in biological plausibility, and no specific assumptions are made on how to implement the feedback in a physical system.},

The renormalized bending rigidity vanishes exponentially at large length scales and its asymptotic behaviour is used to define the persistence length. For semiflexible polymers, our result agrees with the persistence length obtained using the asymptotic behaviour of tangent correlation functions.

The first part of this paper is an introduction to the pertinent ideas from Einstein's theory of curved spacetime, followed by a review of other popular time machine spacetimes. We begin with an introduction to curvature and lightcones. We then explain the Alcubierre Warp Drive, the Morris-Thorne wormhole, and the Tipler cylinder. We then describe the Traversable Achronal Retrograde Domain in Spacetime (TARDIS), and explain some of its general properties. Our TARDIS is a bubble of spacetime curvature which travels along a closed loop in space and time. A person travelling within the bubble will feel a constant acceleration. A person outside of the TARDIS will see two bubbles: one which is evolving forwards in time, and one which is evolving backwards in time. We then discuss the physical limitations which may prevent us from ever constructing a TARDIS. Finally, we discuss the method through which a TARDIS can be used to travel between arbitrary points in space and time, and the possible dangers involved with exiting a TARDIS from the wrong side.

  abstract = {The influence of the microstructures of different ?-carrageenan gels on the self-diffusion behavior of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the diffusion behavior was determined mainly by the void size, which in turn was defined by the state of aggregation of the ?-carrageenan. The ?-carrageenan concentration was held constant at 1 w/w\%, and the aggregation was controlled by the amount of potassium and/or sodium chloride and, for samples containing potassium, also by the cooling rate. Gels containing potassium formed microstructures where ?-carrageenan strands are rather evenly distributed over the image size, while sodium gels formed dense biopolymer clusters interspersed with large openings. In a gel with small void sizes, relatively slow diffusion was found for all PEG sizes investigated. Extended studies of the self-diffusion behavior of the 634 g mol-1 PEG showed that there is a strong time dependence in the measured PEG diffusion. An asymptotic lower time limit of the diffusion coefficient was found in all gels when the diffusion observation time was increased. According to the ratio, D/D0, where D0 is the diffusion coefficient in D2O and D is the diffusion coefficient in the gels, the gels could be divided into three classes:? small, medium, and large voids. For quenched ?-carrageenan solutions with salt concentrations of 20 mM K+, 100 mM K+, or 20 mM K+/200 mM Na+ as well as slowly cooled solutions with only 20 mM K+, D/D0 ratios between 0.18 and 0.29 were obtained. By quenching a ?-carrageenan solution with 100 mM K+, the D/D0 was 0.5, while D/D0 ratios between 0.9 and 1 were obtained in a quenched solution with 250 mM Na+ and slowly cooled samples with 20 mM K+/200 mM Na+ or 250 mM Na+.},

The extracellular matrix receptor, integrin beta 1, induced focal adhesion formation and supported a force-dependent stiffening response, whereas nonadhesion receptors did not. The cytoskeletal stiffness (ratio of stress to strain) increased in direct proportion to the applied stress and required intact microtubules and intermediate filaments as well as microfilaments. Tensegrity models that incorporate mechanically interdependent struts and strings that reorient globally in response to a localized stress mimicked this response. These results suggest that integrins act as mechanoreceptors and transmit mechanical signals to the cytoskeleton. Mechanotransduction, in turn, may be mediated simultaneously at multiple locations inside the cell through force-induced rearrangements within a tensionally integrated cytoskeleton.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.02.002},
  abstract = {Dynamic oscillatory shear tests are common in rheology and have been used to investigate a wide range of soft matter and complex fluids including polymer melts and solutions, block copolymers, biological macromolecules, polyelectrolytes, surfactants, suspensions, emulsions and beyond. More specifically, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) tests have become the canonical method for probing the linear viscoelastic properties of these complex fluids because of the firm theoretical background [1\textendash{}4] and the ease of implementing suitable test protocols. However, in most processing operations the deformations can be large and rapid: it is therefore the nonlinear material properties that control the system response. A full sample characterization thus requires well-defined nonlinear test protocols. Consequently there has been a recent renewal of interest in exploiting large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) tests to investigate and quantify the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of complex fluids. In terms of the experimental input, both LAOS and SAOS require the user to select appropriate ranges of strain amplitude ($\gamma$0) and frequency ($\omega$). However, there is a distinct difference in the analysis of experimental output, i.e. the material response. At sufficiently large strain amplitude, the material response will become nonlinear in LAOS tests and the familiar material functions used to quantify the linear behavior in SAOS tests are no longer sufficient. For example, the definitions of the linear viscoelastic moduli G${'}$($\omega$) and G${''}$($\omega$) are based inherently on the assumption that the stress response is purely sinusoidal (linear). However, a nonlinear stress response is not a perfect sinusoid and therefore the viscoelastic moduli are not uniquely defined; other methods are needed for quantifying the nonlinear material response under LAOS deformation. In the present review article, we first summarize the typical nonlinear responses observed with complex fluids under LAOS deformations. We then introduce and critically compare several methods that quantify the nonlinear oscillatory stress response. We illustrate the utility and sensitivity of these protocols by investigating the nonlinear response of various complex fluids over a wide range of frequency and amplitude of deformation, and show that LAOS characterization is a rigorous test for rheological models and advanced quality control.},

Alternative explanation of stiffening in cross-linked semiflexible networks. Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 178102]. These simulations make use of a geometrically nonlinear finite-element technique, taking into account the discreteness of the biopolymer network. As an alternative to the prevalent view, these computations relate the stiffening to nonaffine network reorientations. However, this discrete-network model neglects any interaction of the filaments with the surrounding fluid, which is the origin of entropic stiffening in single filaments and in biopolymer networks, according to MacKintosh et al. For this reason, this article is devoted to a thorough study of the difference between both approaches on the 2D single-filament level. In addition, we investigate the deviation from affine deformation behavior, by comparing the discrete calculations with an affine-network model.},

Turbidity measurements were employed for the determination of average fiber diameter. Self-similar structure of the gel network was found to be realized in the range between those two scales. The fibrin gels formed by larger amounts of thrombin showed a smaller fractal dimension that, deduced by the box-counting method, was in good agreement with the result from 3-d FT analysis and with a recent dynamic light scattering study (Kita R. et al.

Clustering of integrins is known to mediate signaling through a variety of signal transduction pathways. Yet, the molecular mechanisms of integrin clustering are poorly understood. In this paper, we develop computational models, using agent based modeling (ABM) techniques, to explore two key underlying mechanisms of integrin clustering, namely ligand organization and integrin homo-oligomerization. Our models help to shed light on the potential roles ligand clustering and integrin homo-oligomerization may play in controlling integrin clustering. A potential mechanism for the clustering of integrin is discussed and the effects of other parameters such as integrin\textendash{}ligand affinity, membrane crowdedness and ligand mobility on integrin clustering are examined.},

A nested solution technique enables the mutual transfer of information between global and local scales which are solved simultaneously in a finite element analysis. Therefore, apart from improving the coarse-scale solution by considering fine-scale features, a detailed simulation of the micro-level also enables the determination of local fine-scale quantities of interest. To account for transient effects, a dynamic simulation on the macro-scale is locally coupled to a quasi-static simulation of the discretized micro-level. For time integration, the generalized-$\alpha$ scheme is employed on both scales. The presented algorithm is applicable for large deformations, rotations and arbitrary micro-structural behavior. On the macro-level, no constitutive assumption is required since the stress\textendash{}strain relationship is directly computed from the micro-scale using established computational homogenization procedures. First simulations validate the novel approach and demonstrate its suitability for lung parenchyma considering complex surfactant film dynamics as an example of fine-scale multi-physics.},

  abstract = {The results of microrheological studies carried out on ionotropic pectin gels, particularly the manifest power law behavior observed at high frequencies, indicate that by using different assembly conditions gels can be formed in which the elementary network strands have different stiffnesses. It has been hypothesized that these differences reflect different network architectures, the extreme cases of which might be described as (i) dimeric calcium-chelating junction-zones of limited extent, linked by considerably longer, flexible, single-chain sections, or (ii) semiflexible bundles consisting of extensively aggregated dimeric junction zones that latterly become entangled and cross-linked. To test this hypothesis directly, microrheologically distinct pectin gels have been generated using different assembly modalities, in particular by using different concentrations of polymer and cross-linking ions and by contrasting the controlled-release of ions or ion-binding groups, and the resulting systems have been studied by small-angle X-ray scattering. The results straightforwardly reveal that gels that are clearly more semiflexible from a microrheological point-of-view contain larger scattering entities than those with a more flexible character. Furthermore, a more detailed interpretation of the scattering data with the aid of molecular modeling suggests that for the gels formed here those with a semiflexible microrheological signature consist predominantly of network filaments consisting of four or more chains, whereas those with a more flexible signature are predominantly single-chain sections linked by dimeric associations with no more that a few percent of the chains bundled to any higher extent. The ability to generate differing network architectures from the same polymer that fulfill different functional requirements, either in vivo in the plant cell wall, where pectin plays a crucial structural and mechanical role, or in vitro in a myriad of applications, makes these biomimetic biopolymer networks of considerable interest.},

The quenched average of the free energy turns out to be subadditive with respect to the size of the system. This gives immediately convergence of the free energy per site, in the infinite volume limit. Moreover, a simple argument, based on concentration of measure, gives the almost sure convergence, with respect to the external noise.

This early-stage platelet deposition and accumulation triggers the initiation of hemostasis, a self-defensive mechanism to prevent the body from excessive blood loss. To understand and predict this complex process, one must integrate experimentally determined information on the mechanics and biochemical kinetics of participating receptors over very small time frames (1\textendash{}1000 $\mu$s) and length scales (10\textendash{}100 nm), to collective phenomena occurring over seconds and tens of microns. In the present study, a unique three dimensional multiscale computational model, Platelet Adhesive Dynamics (PAD), was applied to elucidate the unique physics of (i) a non-spherical, disk-shaped platelet interacting and tethering onto the damaged vessel wall followed by (ii) collisional interactions between a flowing platelet with a downstream adherent platelet. By analyzing numerous simulations under different physiological conditions, we conclude that the platelet's unique spheroid-shape provides heterogeneous, orientation-dependent translocation (rolling) behavior which enhances cell-wall interactions. We also conclude that platelet\textendash{}platelet near field interactions are critical for cell\textendash{}cell communication during the initiation of microthrombi. The PAD model described here helps to identify the physical factors that control the initial stages of platelet capture during this process.},

We study this field theory using the renormalization group. For mesoscopic length and time scales, and for space dimension d $\backslash$geq 2, the behaviour of the model is governed by a zero-temperature dynamical critical point in the directed percolation universality class. We argue that in d=1 its behaviour is that of compact directed percolation. We perform detailed numerical simulations of the corresponding Fredrickson-Andersen model on the lattice in various dimensions, and find reasonable quantitative agreement with the field theory predictions.},

The networks considered are subisostatic random-bond networks that, in the athermal limit, are known to have vanishing bulk and linear shear moduli at zero bulk strain. Above a bulk strain threshold, however, these networks become rigid, although surprisingly the shear modulus remains zero until a second, higher, strain threshold. We find that thermal fluctuations stabilize all networks below the rigidity transition, resulting in systems with both finite bulk and shear moduli. Our results show a T0.66 temperature dependence of the moduli in the region below the bulk strain threshold, resulting in networks with anomalously high rigidity as compared to ordinary entropic elasticity. Furthermore, we find a second regime of anomalous temperature scaling for the shear modulus at its zero-temperature rigidity point, where it scales as T0.5, behavior that is absent for the bulk modulus since its athermal rigidity transition is discontinuous.},

  abstract = {Most tissue cells grown in sparse cultures on linearly elastic substrates typically display a small, round phenotype on soft substrates and become increasingly spread as the modulus of the substrate increases until their spread area reaches a maximum value. As cell density increases, individual cells retain the same stiffness-dependent differences unless they are very close or in molecular contact. On nonlinear strain-stiffening fibrin gels, the same cell types become maximally spread even when the low strain elastic modulus would predict a round morphology, and cells are influenced by the presence of neighbors hundreds of microns away. Time lapse microscopy reveals that fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells on fibrin deform the substrate by several microns up to five cell lengths away from their plasma membrane through a force limited mechanism. Atomic force microscopy and rheology confirm that these strains locally and globally stiffen the gel, depending on cell density, and this effect leads to long distance cell-cell communication and alignment. Thus cells are acutely responsive to the nonlinear elasticity of their substrates and can manipulate this rheological property to induce patterning.},

  abstract = {In this report we review the fundamentals, applications and future tendencies of dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. Our focus is on understanding why the changes observed in the dynamic properties of a vibrating tip that interacts with a surface make possible to obtain molecular resolution images of membrane proteins in aqueous solutions or to resolve atomic-scale surface defects in ultra high vacuum (UHV). Our description of the two major dynamic AFM modes, amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) and frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) emphasises their common points without ignoring the differences in experimental set-ups and operating conditions. Those differences are introduced by the different feedback parameters, oscillation amplitude in AM-AFM and frequency shift and excitation amplitude in FM-AFM, used to track the topography and composition of a surface.

The theoretical analysis of AM-AFM (also known as tapping-mode) emphasises the coexistence, in many situations of interests, of two stable oscillation states, a low and high amplitude solution. The coexistence of those oscillation states is a consequence of the presence of attractive and repulsive components in the interaction force and their non-linear dependence on the tip\textendash{}surface separation. We show that key relevant experimental properties such as the lateral resolution, image contrast and sample deformation are highly dependent on the oscillation state chosen to operate the instrument. AM-AFM allows to obtain simultaneous topographic and compositional contrast in heterogeneous samples by recording the phase angle difference between the external excitation and the tip motion (phase imaging). Significant applications of AM-AFM such as high-resolution imaging of biomolecules and polymers, large-scale patterning of silicon surfaces, manipulation of single nanoparticles or the fabrication of single electron devices are also reviewed.

FM-AFM (also called non-contact AFM\textemdash{}NC-AFM) has achieved the long-standing goal of true atomic resolution with AFM in UHV. Our analysis starts with a discussion of the relation between frequency shifts and tip\textendash{}surface interactions, emphasising the ability of perturbation theory to describe the measured frequency shift. We discuss the role of short-range chemical interactions in the atomic contrast, with particular attention to semiconductor and ionic (alkali halides and oxides) surfaces. Also included is a detailed quantitative comparison between theoretical simulations and experiment. Inversion procedures, the determination of the tip\textendash{}sample interaction from the frequency shift versus distance curves above specific sites, are also reviewed. We finish with a discussion of the optimal range of experimental operation parameters, and the use of damping (excitation amplitude) as a source of atomic contrast, including the possible interpretation in terms of microscopic dissipation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Despite their overwhelming complexity, living cells display a high degree of internal mechanical and functional organization which can largely be attributed to the intracellular biopolymer scaffold, the cytoskeleton. Being a very complex system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the cytoskeleton's ability to organize is at the same time challenging and fascinating. The extensive amounts of frequently interacting cellular building blocks and their inherent multifunctionality permits highly adaptive behavior and obstructs a purely reductionist approach. Nevertheless (and despite the field's relative novelty), the physics approach has already proved to be extremely successful in revealing very fundamental concepts of cytoskeleton organization and behavior. This review aims at introducing the physics of the cytoskeleton ranging from single biopolymer filaments to multicellular organisms. Throughout this wide range of phenomena, the focus is set on the intertwined nature of the different physical scales (levels of complexity) that give rise to numerous emergent properties by means of self-organization or self-assembly.},

  abstract = {The endpoint distribution and dynamics of semiflexible fibers are studied by numerical simulation. A brief overview is given over the analytical theory of flexible and semiflexible polymers. In particular, a closed expression is given for the relaxation spectrum of wormlike chains, which determines polymer diffusion and rheology. Next a simulation model for wormlike chains with full hydrodynamic interaction is described, and relations for the bending and torsion modulus are given. Two methods are introduced to include torsion stiffness into the model. The model is validated by simulating single chains in a heat bath, and comparing the endpoint distribution of the chains with established Monte Carlo results. It is concluded that torsion stiffness leads to a slightly shorter effective persistence length for a given bending stiffness. To further validate the simulation model, polymer diffusion is studied for fixed persistence length and varying polymer length N. The diffusion constant shows crossover from Rouse (D $\propto$ N -1) to reptation behaviour (D $\propto$ N -2). The terminal relaxation time obtained from the monomer displacement is consistent with the theory of wormlike chains. The probability for chain crossing has also been studied. This probability is so low that it does not influence the present results.},

Micromechanical simulations of biopolymer networks have thus attracted increasing interest in the last years. Here we introduce a simulation framework for biopolymer networks based on a finite element model of the filaments with a backward Euler time integration scheme. This approach surpasses previously published ones, especially those based on bead-spring models, by its sound theoretical foundation, a great flexibility, and at the same time an efficiency gain of approximately two orders of magnitude. Thereby it allows for addressing problems no previous numerical method could deal with, e.g., the micromechanical analysis of the viscoelastic moduli of crosslinked biopolymer networks in the low frequency regime or the analysis of the thermal equilibrium phases of such networks. By means of several examples it is discussed how this capacity can be exploited in multiscale simulations of biological tissue on cellular and subcellular scale.},

  doi = {10.1088/1367-2630/15/3/035006},
  abstract = {Propulsion by growing actin networks is a universal mechanism used in many different biological systems, ranging from the sheet-like lamellipodium of crawling animal cells to the actin comet tails induced by certain bacteria and viruses in order to move within their host cells. Although the core molecular machinery for actin network growth is well preserved in all of these cases, the geometry of the propelled obstacle varies considerably. During recent years, filament orientation distribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the structure and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several continuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing behind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady state orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete filaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate that for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation patterns peaked at either $\pm$35$^\circ$ or +70$^\circ$/0$^\circ$/ - 70$^\circ$ exhibit mutually exclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of very large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a function of model parameters and show how this approach can be extended to obstacles with piecewise straight contours. For curved obstacles, we arrive at a partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which again is in good agreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same two fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an appropriate reference frame, which is adjusted to the local orientation of the obstacle contour. Our results suggest that two fundamentally different network architectures compete with each other in growing actin networks, irrespective of obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data have to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.},

Two basic approaches are described in the literature\textemdash{}one based on skeletonization and another based on sequential tracing along neuronal processes. This article presents algorithms for improving the rate of detection, and the accuracy of estimating the location and process angles at branching points for the latter class of algorithms. The problem of simultaneously detecting branch points and estimating their measurements is formulated as a generalized likelihood ratio test defined on a spatial neighborhood of each candidate point, in which likelihoods were computed using a ridge detection approach. The average detection rate increased from from 37 to 86\%. The average error in locating the branch points decreased from 2.6 to 2.1 voxels in 3D images. The generalized hypothesis test improves the rate of detection of branching points, and the accuracy of location estimates, enabling a more complete extraction of neuroanatomy and more accurate counting of branch points in neuronal assays. More accurate branch point morphometry is valuable for image registration and change analysis. \textcopyright{} 2007 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

  abstract = {The central role of the cytoskeleton in both healthy and diseased cellular functions makes it a compelling subject for detailed three-dimensional (3D) micromechanical modeling. Microstructural features of the cytoskeleton govern the cell's mechanical behavior in many of the regulating cellular functions including cell division, adhesion, spreading, migration, contraction, and other mechanotransductive effects which influence biochemical processes. Actin microfilaments (AF) combine to form one of the predominant cytoskeletal networks important to these biological processes.
Here, the AF cytoskeletal microstructure and stress-strain behavior is modeled via a microstructurally-informed continuum mechanics approach. The force-extension behavior of the individual filaments is captured using the MacKintosh derivation of the worm-like chain (WLC) constitutive relationship for short chains where a new and direct analytical expression for the filament force as a function of filament extension is developed in this paper. The filament force-extension behavior is then used in conjunction with the Arruda-Boyce eight-chain network model to capture the 3D multiaxial stress-strain behavior of the network. The resulting 3D cytoskeletal network constitutive model provides the ability to track microstructural stretch and orientation states during 3D macroscopic stretching conditions. The non-affine nature of the network model effectively accommodates the imposed macroscopic shear strain through filament rotation and a relatively small amount of filament stretch. These characteristics enable the network model, using physically realistic material properties, to capture the initial stiffness of the AF network as well as the nonlinear strain stiffening observed at large stresses. The network model predictions compare favorably with published microrheological data of in vitro AF networks.},

The molecular structures and design principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress\textendash{}strain relations at low to intermediate strains. The input to this theory is the force\textendash{}extension curve for individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these filaments are homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly.

The ``egg-box'' model describes the gel-inducing ions embodied in cavities formed by sequences of $\alpha$-L-GulA of the alginate copolymers in a pairing reaction yielding junction zones. Small-angle X-ray scattering showed that the cross-sectional radius of gyration for an alginate with fraction of $\alpha$-L-GulA, FG, = 0.39, increased from Rg,c = 3.5\AA{} for alginate in solution to 7.6\AA{} for homogeneous Ca-gels at [Ca2+] = 10 mM. The homogeneous Ca-alginate gels were obtained by in situ release of Ca2+ from Ca-EGTA or CaCO3 using a slowly hydrolyzing lactone. Either increasing the [Ca2+] for a given FG or increasing FG by selection of an alginate from a different seaweed specie and using constant [Ca2+], yielded larger initial slopes and curvature in the cross-sectional plots of the SAXS data. This indicate the coexistence of junction zones differing in multiplicity characterized by shifting the distribution towards larger multiplicity either for increasing FG or [Ca2+]. The present finding of junction zone formation by lateral condensation of $\alpha$-L-GulA sequences depending on the composition of alginate and Ca-concentration are significant extensions of the ``egg-box'' model that correlate the sequential arrangement of $\alpha$-L-GulA and $\beta$-D-ManA in alginate to the structure of the junction zones in the Ca-alginate gels.},

  abstract = {Atomic force microscope manipulations of single polysaccharide molecules have recently expanded conformational chemistry to include force-driven transitions between the chair and boat conformers of the pyranose ring structure. We now expand these observations to include chair inversion, a common phenomenon in the conformational chemistry of six-membered ring molecules. We demonstrate that by stretching single pectin molecules (1 $\rightarrow$ 4-linked $\alpha$-d-galactouronic acid polymer), we could change the pyranose ring conformation from a chair to a boat and then to an inverted chair in a clearly resolved two-step conversion: 4C1 $\rightleftarrows$ boat $\rightleftarrows$ 1C4. The two-step extension of the distance between the glycosidic oxygen atoms O1 and O4 determined by atomic force microscope manipulations is corroborated by ab initio calculations of the increase in length of the residue vector O1O4 on chair inversion. We postulate that this conformational change results from the torque generated by the glycosidic bonds when a force is applied to the pectin molecule. Hence, the glycosidic bonds act as mechanical levers, driving the conformational transitions of the pyranose ring. When the glycosidic bonds are equatorial (e), the torque is zero, causing no conformational change. However, when the glycosidic bond is axial (a), torque is generated, causing a rotation around C\textemdash{}C bonds and a conformational change. This hypothesis readily predicts the number of transitions observed in pyranose monomers with 1a-4a linkages (two), 1a-4e (one), and 1e-4e (none). Our results demonstrate single-molecule mechanochemistry with the capability of resolving complex conformational transitions.},

Recently, it has been recognized that stromal biology is also altered significantly with preinvasive disease. We used the finite-difference time-domain method, a popular technique in computational electromagnetics, to model light scattering from heterogeneous collagen fiber networks and to analyze how neoplastic changes alter stromal scattering properties. Three-dimensional optical images from the stroma of fresh normal and neoplastic oral-cavity biopsies were acquired using fluorescence confocal microscopy. These optical sections were then processed to create realistic three-dimensional collagen networks as model input. Image analysis revealed that the volume fraction of collagen fibers in the stroma decreases with precancer and cancer progression, and fibers tend to be shorter and more disconnected in neoplastic stroma. The finite-difference time-domain modeling results showed that neoplastic fiber networks have smaller scattering cross sections compared to normal networks. Computed scattering-phase functions indicate that high-angle scattering probabilities tend to be higher for neoplastic networks. These results provide valuable insight into the micro-optical properties of normal and neoplastic stroma. Characterization of optical signals obtained from epithelial tissues can aid in development of optical spectroscopic and imaging techniques for noninvasive monitoring of early neoplastic changes.},

  abstract = {We show that the nonlinear mechanical response of networks formed from un\textendash{}cross-linked fibrin or collagen type I continually changes in response to repeated large-strain loading. We demonstrate that this dynamic evolution of the mechanical response arises from a shift of a characteristic nonlinear stress\textendash{}strain relationship to higher strains. Therefore, the imposed loading does not weaken the underlying matrices but instead delays the occurrence of the strain stiffening. Using confocal microscopy, we present direct evidence that this behavior results from persistent lengthening of individual fibers caused by an interplay between fiber stretching and fiber buckling when the networks are repeatedly strained. Moreover, we show that covalent cross-linking of fibrin or collagen inhibits the shift of the nonlinear material response, suggesting that the molecular origin of individual fiber lengthening may be slip of monomers within the fibers. Thus, a fibrous architecture in combination with constituents that exhibit internal plasticity creates a material whose mechanical response adapts to external loading conditions. This design principle may be useful to engineer novel materials with this capability.},

  abstract = {Biological semiflexible polymers and filaments such as collagen, fibronectin, actin, microtubules, coiled-coil proteins, DNA, siRNA, amyloid fibrils, etc., are ubiquitous in nature. In biology, these systems have a direct relation to critical processes ranging from the movement of actin or assembly of viruses at cellular interfaces to the growth of amyloid plaques in neurodegenerative diseases. In technology and applied sciences, synthetic macromolecules or fibrous objects such as carbon nanotubes are involved in countless applications. Accessing their intrinsic properties at the single molecule level, such as their molecular conformations or intrinsic stiffness, is central to the understanding of these systems, their properties, and the design of related applications. In this Perspective we introduce FiberApp?a new tracking and analysis software based on a cascade of algorithms describing structural and topological features of objects characterized by a very high length-to-width aspect ratio, generally described as ?fiber-like objects?. The program operates on images from any microscopic source (atomic force or transmission electron microscopy, optical, fluorescence, confocal, etc.), acquiring the spatial coordinates of objects by a semiautomated tracking procedure based on A* pathfinding algorithm followed by the application of active contour models and generating virtually any statistical, topological, and graphical output derivable from these coordinates. Demonstrative features of the software include statistical polymer physics analysis of fiber conformations, height, bond and pair correlation functions, mean-squared end-to-end distance and midpoint displacement, 2D order parameter, excess kurtosis, fractal exponent, height profile and its discrete Fourier transform, orientation, length, height, curvature, and kink angle distributions, providing an unprecedented structural description of filamentous synthetic and biological objects.},

  abstract = {The skeleton is an important representation for shape analysis. A common approach for generating discrete skeletons takes three steps: 1) computing the distance map, 2) detecting maximal disks from the distance map, and 3) linking the centers of maximal disks (CMDs) into a connected skeleton. Algorithms using approximate distance metrics are abundant and their theory has been well established. However, the resulting skeletons may be inaccurate and sensitive to rotation. In this paper, we study methods for generating skeletons based on the exact Euclidean metric. We first show that no previous algorithms identify the exact set of discrete maximal disks under the Euclidean metric. We then propose new algorithms and show that they are correct. To link CMDs into connected skeletons, we examine two prevalent approaches: connected thinning and steepest ascent. We point out that the connected thinning approach does not work properly for Euclidean distance maps. Only the steepest ascent algorithm produces skeletons that are truly medially placed. The resulting skeletons have all the desirable properties: they have the same simple connectivity as the figure, they are well-centered, they are insensitive to rotation, and they allow exact reconstruction. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated with numerous examples},

  abstract = {Materials characterized by spatially homogeneous elastic moduli undergo affine distortions when subjected to external stress at their boundaries, i.e., their displacements \$$\backslash$uv ($\backslash$xv)\$ from a uniform reference state grow linearly with position \$$\backslash$xv\$, and their strains are spatially constant. Many materials, including all macroscopically isotropic amorphous ones, have elastic moduli that vary randomly with position, and they necessarily undergo nonaffine distortions in response to external stress. We study general aspects of nonaffine response and correlation using analytic calculations and numerical simulations. We define nonaffine displacements \$$\backslash$uv' ($\backslash$xv)\$ as the difference between \$$\backslash$uv ($\backslash$xv)\$ and affine displacements, and we investigate the nonaffinity correlation function \$$\backslash$mathcal\{G\} = $<$ [$\backslash$uv'($\backslash$xv) - $\backslash$uv' (0)]\^2$>$\$ and related functions. We introduce four model random systems with random elastic moduli induced by locally random spring constants, by random coordination number, by random stress, or by any combination of these. We show analytically and numerically that \$$\backslash$mathcal\{G\}\$ scales as \$A |$\backslash$xv|\^\{-(d-2)\}\$ where the amplitude \$A\$ is proportional to the variance of local elastic moduli regardless of the origin of their randomness. We show that the driving force for nonaffine displacements is a spatial derivative of the random elastic constant tensor times the constant affine strain. Random stress by itself does not drive nonaffine response, though the randomness in elastic moduli it may generate does. We study models with both short and long-range correlations in random elastic moduli.},

  abstract = {Abstract-The scale-space technique introduced by Witkin involves generating coarser resolution images by convolving the original image with a Gaussian kernel. This approach has a major drawback: it is difficult to obtain accurately the locations of the ``semantically mean-ingful '' edges at coarse scales. In this paper we suggest a new definition of scale-space, and introduce a class of algorithms that realize it using a diffusion process. The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing in preference to interregion smoothing. It is shown that the ``no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales '' property of conventional scale space is pre-served. As the region boundaries in our approach remain sharp, we obtain a high quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. The algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image making parallel hardware implementations feasible.

The topology of network graphs revealed small-world properties for very different real systems among these neuronal networks. In this study, we observed the early development of mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) networks in vitro using time-lapse video microscopy. By means of a time-resolved graph theoretical analysis of the connectivity, shortest path length and the edge length, we were able to discover the different stages during the network formation. Starting from single cells, at the first stage neurons connected to each other ending up in a network with maximum complexity. In the further course, we observed a simplification of the network which manifested in a change of relevant network parameters such as the minimization of the path length. Moreover, we found that RGC networks self-organized as small-world networks at both stages; however, the optimization occurred only in the second stage.},

  abstract = {We investigated membrane-like polymer structures of fractal connectivity such as Sierpinski gaskets and Sierpinski carpets applying the bond fluctuation model in three dimensions. Without excluded volume (phantom), both polymeric fractals obey Gaussian elasticity on larger scales determined by their spectral dimension. On the other hand, the swelling effect due to excluded volume is rather distinct between the two polymeric fractals: Self-avoiding Sierpinski gaskets can be described using a Flory-type mean-field argument. Sierpinski carpets having a spectral dimension closer to perfect membranes are significantly more strongly swollen than predicted. Based on our simulation results it cannot be excluded that Sierpinski carpets in athermal solvent show a flat phase on larger scales. We tested the self-consistency of Flory predictions using a virial expansion to higher orders. From this we conclude that the third virial coefficient contributes marginally to Sierpinski gaskets, but higher order virial coefficients are relevant for Sierpinski carpets.},

  abstract = {Self-assembled hydrogen-bonded networks of the polysaccharide pectin, a mechanically functional component of plant cell walls, have been of recent interest as biomimetic exemplars of physical gels, and the micro-rheological and strain-stiffening behaviour have been previously investigated. Despite this detailed rheological characterisation of pre-formed gels, little is known about the fundamental arrangement of the polymers into cross-linking junction zones, the size of these bonded regions, and the resultant network architecture in these hydrogen-bonded materials, especially in contrast to the plethora of such information available for their well-known calcium-assembled counterparts. In this work, in concert with pertinent rheological measurements, an in-depth structural study of the hydrogen-bond-mediated gelation of pectins is provided. Gels were realised by using glucona-delta-lactone (GDL) to decrease the pH of solutions of pectic polymers that had a (blockwise) low degree of methylesterification (low DM). Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to access structural information on length scales on the order of nanometres to hundreds of nanometres, while complementary mechanical properties were measured, predominantly using small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology.},

The audience is mainly first-year graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however. The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is, arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and instantons via path integrals. For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic) of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field theory.},

We start with a broad introduction to the field and emphasize its connections with other subjects and its relevance. The important role played by computer simulations to study and understand the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is spelled out. We review the recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics. We then present the main theoretical approaches describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures, and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, we give an extensive overview of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that, we believe, will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.},

The fixed points and exponents are calculated to two-loop order. We use the dimensional regularization scheme, carefully keeping the full d dependence originating from the angular parts of the loop integrals. For dimensions less than dc=2 we find a strong-coupling fixed point, which diverges at d=2, indicating that there is nonperturbative strong-coupling behavior for all d$\geq$2. At d=1 our method yields the identical fixed point as in the one-loop approximation, and the two-loop contributions to the scaling functions are nonsingular. For d$>$2 dimensions, there is no finite strong-coupling fixed point. In the framework of a 2+$\epsilon$ expansion, we find the dynamic exponent corresponding to the unstable fixed point, which described the nonequilibrium roughening transition, to be z=2+O($\epsilon$3), in agreement with a recent scaling argument by Doty and Kosterlitz [Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 1979 (1992)]. Similarly, our result for the correlation length exponent at the transition is 1/$\nu$=$\epsilon$+O($\epsilon$3). For the smooth phase, some aspects of the crossover from Gaussian to critical behavior are discussed.},

It is used to investigate processes such as drug and gene delivery, viral uptake, intracellular trafficking or membrane-bound protein mobility. Traditionally, SPT is performed in two dimensions (2D) because of its technical simplicity. However, life occurs in three dimensions (3D) and many methods have been recently developed to track particles in 3D. Now, is the third dimension worth the effort? Here we investigate the differences between the 2D and 3D analyses of intracellular transport with the 3D development of a time-resolved mean square displacement (MSD) analysis introduced previously. The 3D trajectories, and the 2D projections, of fluorescent nanoparticles were obtained with an orbital tracking microscope in two different cell types: in Dictyostelium discoideum ameba and in adherent, more flattened HuH-7 human cells. As expected from the different 3D organization of both cells' cytoskeletons, a third of the active transport was lost upon projection in the ameba whereas the identification of the active phases was barely affected in the HuH-7 cells. In both cell types, we found intracellular diffusion to be anisotropic and the diffusion coefficient values derived from the 2D analysis were therefore biased.},

There is substantial evidence from reconstituted F-actin gels that a regime exists in which the moduli scale with frequency with a universal exponent of 3/4. Such behaviour is entropic in origin and is attributable to fluctuations in semiflexible polymers driven by thermal forces, but it is not obvious a priori that such entropic effects are responsible for the elasticity of the CSK. Here we demonstrate the existence of such a regime in the living cell, but only at high frequencies. Fast events scaled with frequency in a manner comparable to semiflexible-polymer dynamics, but slow events scaled with a non-universal exponent that was systematically smaller than 3/4 and probably more consistent with a soft-glass regime. These findings strongly suggest that at smaller timescales elasticity arises from entropic fluctuations of a semiflexible-filament network, whereas on longer timescales slow (soft-glass-like) dynamics of a different origin prevail. The transition between these two regimes occurred on timescales of the order of 0.01 s, thus setting within the slow glassy regime cellular events such as spreading, crawling, contracting, and invading.},

We analytically study the nonlinear force\textendash{}extension relation of an array of parallel-aligned, strongly stretched semiflexible polymers with random cross-links. In the strong stretching limit, the effect of the cross-links is purely entropic, independent of the bending rigidity of the chains. Cross-links enhance the differential stretching stiffness of the bundle. For hard cross-links, the cross-link contribution to the force\textendash{}extension relation scales inversely proportional to the force. Its dependence on the cross-link density, close to the gelation transition, is the same as that of the shear modulus. The qualitative behaviour is captured by a toy model of two chains with a single cross-link in the middle.},

In two dimensions, we confirm the predicted exponentv=3/4 and the hyperscaling relation; we estimate the universal ratios $<$R g 2 $>$/$<$R e 2 $>$=0.14026$\pm$0.00007, $<$R m 2 $>$/$<$R e 2 $>$=0.43961$\pm$0.00034, and $\Psi$*=0.66296$\pm$0.00043 (68\% confidence limits). In three dimensions, we estimatev=0.5877$\pm$0.0006 with a correctionto-scaling exponent$\Delta$ 1=0.56$\pm$0.03 (subjective 68\% confidence limits). This value forv agrees excellently with the field-theoretic renormalization-group prediction, but there is some discrepancy for$\Delta$ 1. Earlier Monte Carlo estimates ofv, which were $\approx$0.592, are now seen to be biased by corrections to scaling. We estimate the universal ratios $<$R g 2 $>$/$<$R e 2 $>$=0.1599$\pm$0.0002 and $\Psi$*=0.2471$\pm$0.0003; since $\Psi$*$>$0, hyperscaling holds. The approach to $\Psi$* is from above, contrary to the prediction of the two-parameter renormalization-group theory. We critically reexamine this theory, and explain where the error lies. In an appendix, we prove rigorously (modulo some standard scaling assumptions) the hyperscaling relationdv = 2$\Delta$ 4 -$\gamma$ for two-dimensional SAWs.},

  doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btr237},
  abstract = {Motivation: Digital reconstruction, or tracing, of 3D neuron structures is critical toward reverse engineering the wiring and functions of a brain. However, despite a number of existing studies, this task is still challenging, especially when a 3D microscopic image has low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fragmented neuron segments. Published work can handle these hard situations only by introducing global prior information, such as where a neurite segment starts and terminates. However, manual incorporation of such global information can be very time consuming. Thus, a completely automatic approach for these hard situations is highly desirable.
Results: We have developed an automatic graph algorithm, called the all-path pruning (APP), to trace the 3D structure of a neuron. To avoid potential mis-tracing of some parts of a neuron, an APP first produces an initial over-reconstruction, by tracing the optimal geodesic shortest path from the seed location to every possible destination voxel/pixel location in the image. Since the initial reconstruction contains all the possible paths and thus could contain redundant structural components (SC), we simplify the entire reconstruction without compromising its connectedness by pruning the redundant structural elements, using a new maximal-covering minimal-redundant (MCMR) subgraph algorithm. We show that MCMR has a linear computational complexity and will converge. We examined the performance of our method using challenging 3D neuronal image datasets of model organisms (e.g. fruit fly).
Availability: The software is available upon request. We plan to eventually release the software as a plugin of the V3D-Neuron package at http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/v3d.

  abstract = {Protein adsorption plays a significant role in biological phenomena such as cell-surface interactions and the coagulation of blood. Two-dimensional random sequential adsorption (RSA) models are widely used to model the adsorption of proteins on solid surfaces. Continuum equations have been developed so that the results of RSA simulations can be used to predict the kinetics of adsorption. Recently, Brownian dynamics simulations have become popular for modeling protein adsorption. In this work a continuum model was developed to allow the results from a Brownian dynamics simulation to be used as the boundary condition in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Brownian dynamics simulations were used to model the diffusive transport of hard-sphere particles in a liquid and the adsorption of the particles onto a solid surface. The configuration of the adsorbed particles was analyzed to quantify the chemical potential near the surface, which was found to be a function of the distance from the surface and the fractional surface coverage. The near-surface chemical potential was used to derive a continuum model of adsorption that incorporates the results from the Brownian dynamics simulations. The equations of the continuum model were discretized and coupled to a CFD simulation of diffusive transport to the surface. The kinetics of adsorption predicted by the continuum model closely matched the results from the Brownian dynamics simulation. This new model allows the results from mesoscale simulations to be incorporated into micro- or macro-scale CFD transport simulations of protein adsorption in practical devices.},

Such pixels are characterized by extreme transition values computed using pixel-intensity differences in a small neighborhood. We show how to adjust the threshold of several binary threshold methods which compute gray-intensity thresholds, using the gray-intensity mean and variance of the pixels in the transition set. Our experiments show that the new approach yields segmentation performance superior to several with current state-of-the-art binarization algorithms.},

  abstract = {The Burgers equation is the simplest nonlinear generalization of the diffusion equation. We present a detailed dynamical renormalization-group analysis of this equation subject to random noise. The noise itself can be the product of another stochastic process and is hence allowed to have correlations in space and/or time. In dimensions higher than a critical dc weak and strong noise lead to different scaling exponents, while for d$<$dc any amount of noise is relevant resulting in strong-coupling behavior. In the absence of temporal correlations we find two regimes for d$<$dc: either the hydrodynamic behavior is determined by white noise and correlations are unimportant, or correlations dominate and the resulting scaling exponents can be obtained exactly. With temporal correlations present, the hydrodynamic behavior is much more complex, as renormalization predicts a complicated dependence of the effective noise spectrum on frequency in certain regimes. The relevance of these results to two interesting problems is discussed. One is the anomalous transverse fluctuations of a directed polymer in a random medium, and the other is a description of a growing interface. Various recent numerical simulations are reviewed in the light of these results. For example, we show that an exponent identity observed in all simulations so far follows simply from the Galilean invariance of the equation in the absence of temporal correlations.},

Stretch is a potent stimulus for growth, differentiation, migration, remodelling and gene expression. Here, we report that in response to transient stretch the cytoskeleton fluidizes in such a way as to define a universal response class. This finding implicates mechanisms mediated not only by specific signalling intermediates, as is usually assumed, but also by non-specific actions of a slowly evolving network of physical forces. These results support the idea that the cell interior is at once a crowded chemical space and a fragile soft material in which the effects of biochemistry, molecular crowding and physical forces are complex and inseparable, yet conspire nonetheless to yield remarkably simple phenomenological laws. These laws seem to be both universal and primitive, and thus comprise a striking intersection between the worlds of cell biology and soft matter physics.},

The model adapts existing models in order to accommodate one or more force-induced conformational transformations of the glycan rings and is based on the concept of equilibrium between the clicked (longer conformers) and unclicked states. This equilibrium is determined by the Gibbs energy difference between these two states which is perturbed in favor of the clicked states by the force applied to the molecule. The derived expression is used to generate force-extension curves for model polymers and can illustrate the effect of the Gibbs energy for each transformation on the shape of these curves. It is also used to fit the force-extension curves of polysaccharides to obtain the Gibbs energy differences between the conformers. Good agreement was found between this model and experimental data on carboxymethylamylose, dextran, alginate, and pectin.},

The main objective of this study is to propose a new method to analyze this microcirculation. Methods: From thick sections of india ink-injected human brain, using confocal laser microscopy, the authors developed algorithms adapted to very large data sets to automatically extract and analyze center lines together with diameters of thousands of brain microvessels within a large cortex area. Results: Direct comparison between the original data and the processed vascular skeletons demonstrated the high reliability of this method and its capability to manage a large amount of data, from which morphometry and topology of the cerebral microcirculation could be derived. Conclusions: Among the many parameters that can be analyzed by this method, the capillary size, the frequency distributions of diameters and lengths, the fractal nature of these networks, and the depth-related density of vessels are all vital features for an adequate model of cerebral microcirculation.},

  abstract = {The control of compliant robots is, due to their often nonlinear and complex dynamics, inherently difficult. The vision of morphological computation proposes to view these aspects not only as problems, but rather also as parts of the solution. Non-rigid body parts are not seen anymore as imperfect realizations of rigid body parts, but rather as potential computational resources. The applicability of this vision has already been demonstrated for a variety of complex robot control problems. Nevertheless, a theoretical basis for understanding the capabilities and limitations of morphological computation has been missing so far. We present a model for morphological computation with compliant bodies, where a precise mathematical characterization of the potential computational contribution of a complex physical body is feasible. The theory suggests that complexity and nonlinearity, typically unwanted properties of robots, are desired features in order to provide computational power. We demonstrate that simple generic models of physical bodies, based on mass-spring systems, can be used to implement complex nonlinear operators. By adding a simple readout (which is static and linear) to the morphology such devices are able to emulate complex mappings of input to output streams in continuous time. Hence, by outsourcing parts of the computation to the physical body, the difficult problem of learning to control a complex body, could be reduced to a simple and perspicuous learning task, which can not get stuck in local minima of an error function.},

One concrete model, based on minimum-time routes in a binary hierarchy of roads with different speed limits, has been shown to satisfy the axioms, and two other constructions (based on Poisson line processes and on dynamic proximity graphs) are expected also to do so. We initiate study of structure theory and summary statistics for general processes in the class.

Several fractal and non-fractal parameters have been considered for the quantitative assessment of the vascular architecture, using a variety of test specimens and of computational tools. The fractal parameters have the advantage of being scale invariant, i.e. to be independent of the magnification and resolution of the images to be investigated, making easier the comparison among different setups and experiments.

Results
The success of several commercial and/or free codes in computing the fractal parameters has been tested on well known exact models. Based on such a preliminary study, we selected the code Frac-lac in order to analyze images obtained by visualizing the angiogenetic process occurring in chick Chorio Allontoic Membranes (CAM), assumed to be paradigmatic of a realistic 2D vascular network. Among the parameters investigated, the fractal dimension Df proved to be the most robust estimator for CAM vascular networks. Moreover, only Df was able to discriminate between effective and elusive increases in vascularization after drug-induced angiogenic stimulations on CAMs.

Conclusion
The fractal dimension Df is likely to be the most promising tool for monitoring the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapies in various clinical contexts.},

We consider generic open graphs and show that any cycle leads to narrow resonances which do not fit in any of the prominent paradigms for narrow resonances (classical barriers, localization due to disorder, chaotic scattering). We call these resonances ``topological'' to emphasize their origin in the nontrivial connectivity. Topological resonances have a clear and unique signature which is apparent in the statistics of the resonance parameters (such as, e.g., the width, the delay time, or the wave-function intensity in the graph). We discuss this phenomenon by providing analytical arguments supported by numerical simulation, and identify the features of the above distributions which depend on genuine topological quantities such as the length of the shortest cycle (girth). These signatures cannot be explained using any of the other paradigms for narrow resonances. Finally, we propose an experimental setting where the topological resonances could be demonstrated, and study the stability of the relevant distribution functions to moderate dissipation.},

In this case, it is well-known that polysaccharides, rather than filamentous and tubular protein assemblies, play a major role in satisfying the mechanical requirements of a successful cell wall, but developing a clear structure\textendash{}function understanding has been exacerbated by the familiar issue of biological complexity. Herein, in the spirit of the mesoscopic approaches that have proved so illuminating in the study of cytoskeletal networks, the linear microrheological and strain-stiffening responses of biopolymeric networks reconstituted from pectin, a crucial cell wall polysaccharide, are examined. These are found to be well-captured by the glassy worm-like chain (GWLC) model of self-assembled semi-flexible filaments. Strikingly, the nonlinear mechanical response of these pectin networks is found to be much more sensitive to temperature changes than their linear response, a property that is also observed in F-actin networks, and is well reproduced by the GWLC model. Additionally, microrheological measurements suggest that over long timescales ($>$10 s) internal stresses continue to redistribute facilitating low frequency motions of tracer particles.},

The cellular tensegrity model can now be revisited and placed in context of new advances in our understanding of cell structure, biological networks and mechanoregulation that have been made over the past decade. Recent work provides strong evidence to support the use of tensegrity by cells, and mathematical formulations of the model predict many aspects of cell behavior. In addition, development of the tensegrity theory and its translation into mathematical terms are beginning to allow us to define the relationship between mechanics and biochemistry at the molecular level and to attack the larger problem of biological complexity. Part I of this two-part article covers the evidence for cellular tensegrity at the molecular level and describes how this building system may provide a structural basis for the hierarchical organization of living systems \textemdash{} from molecule to organism. Part II, which focuses on how these structural networks influence information processing networks, appears in the next issue.},

  abstract = {How do molecules interact with each other? What happens if a neurotransmitter binds to a ligand-operated ion channel? How do antibodies recognize their antigens? Molecular recognition events play a pivotal role in nature: in enzymatic catalysis and during the replication and transcription of the genome; it is also important for the cohesion of cellular structures and in numerous metabolic reactions that molecules interact with each other in a specific manner. Conventional methods such as calorimetry provide very precise values of binding enthalpies; these are, however, average values obtained from a large ensemble of molecules without knowledge of the dynamics of the molecular recognition event. Which forces occur when a single molecular couple meets and forms a bond? Since the development of the scanning force microscope and force spectroscopy a couple of years ago, tools have now become available for measuring the forces between interfaces with high precision-starting from colloidal forces to the interaction of single molecules. The manipulation of individual molecules using force spectroscopy is also possible. In this way, the mechanical properties on a molecular scale are measurable. The study of single molecules is not an exclusive domain of force spectroscopy; it can also be performed with a surface force apparatus, laser tweezers, or the micropipette technique. Regardless of these techniques, force spectroscopy has been proven as an extraordinary versatile tool. The intention of this review article is to present a critical evaluation of the actual development of static force spectroscopy. The article mainly focuses on experiments dealing with inter- and intramolecular forces-starting with "simple" electrostatic forces, then ligand-receptor systems, and finally the stretching of individual molecules.},

Such systems are ubiquitous in the cytoskeleton and can be formed in vitro using filamentous actin and various cross-linkers. We find that their high-frequency rheology is characterized by a scaling behavior that is quite distinct from that of networks of the well-studied single semiflexible filaments. This regime can be understood theoretically in terms of a length-scale-dependent bending modulus for bundles. Next, we observe new dissipative dynamics associated with the shear-induced disruption of the network at intermediate frequencies. Finally, at low frequencies, we encounter a region of non-Newtonian rheology characterized by power-law scaling. This regime is dominated by bundle dissolution and large-scale rearrangements of the network driven by equilibrium thermal fluctuations.},

  issn = {0006-3495},
  abstract = {Force-extension (F-x) relationships were measured for single molecules of DNA under a variety of buffer conditions, using an optical trapping interferometer modified to incorporate feedback control. One end of a single DNA molecule was fixed to a coverglass surface by means of a stalled RNA polymerase complex. The other end was linked to a microscopic bead, which was captured and held in an optical trap. The DNA was subsequently stretched by moving the coverglass with respect to the trap using a piezo-driven stage, while the position of the bead was recorded at nanometer-scale resolution. An electronic feedback circuit was activated to prevent bead movement beyond a preset clamping point by modulating the light intensity, altering the trap stiffness dynamically. This arrangement permits rapid determination of the F-x relationship for individual DNA molecules as short as -1 micron with unprecedented accuracy, subjected to both low (approximately 0.1 pN) and high (approximately 50 pN) loads: complete data sets are acquired in under a minute. Experimental F-x relationships were fit over much of their range by entropic elasticity theories based on worm-like chain models. Fits yielded a persistence length, Lp, of approximately 47 nm in a buffer containing 10 mM Na1. Multivalent cations, such as Mg2+ or spermidine 3+, reduced Lp to approximately 40 nm. Although multivalent ions shield most of the negative charges on the DNA backbone, they did not further reduce Lp significantly, suggesting that the intrinsic persistence length remains close to 40 nm. An elasticity theory incorporating both enthalpic and entropic contributions to stiffness fit the experimental results extremely well throughout the full range of extensions and returned an elastic modulus of approximately 1100 pN.},

The simplest architecture is a pom-pom composed of a linear spacer and two z-arm stars at its ends resulting in z-fold tension amplification. Adsorption of those macromolecules on a substrate results in further increase in tension as compared to molecules in solution.},

Their approach has since been extended to other organs of the body, notably including the heart. The modern field of computational biology has expanded rapidly during the first decade of the twenty-first century and, through its contribution to what is now called systems biology, it is set to revise many of the fundamental principles of biology, including the relations between genotypes and phenotypes. Evolutionary theory, in particular, will require re-assessment. To succeed in this, computational and systems biology will need to develop the theoretical framework required to deal with multilevel interactions. While computational power is necessary, and is forthcoming, it is not sufficient. We will also require mathematical insight, perhaps of a nature we have not yet identified. This article is therefore also a challenge to mathematicians to develop such insights.},

Each component of the VD is attributed with a measure of prominence which exhibits the expected invariance under geometric transformations and noise. The second processing step, a hierarchic clustering of skeleton branches, leads to a multiresolution representation of the skeleton, termed skeleton pyramid.},

These cytoskeletal networks, together with various cross-linking and other associated proteins largely determine the (visco)elastic response of cells. In this Letter we study a model system of cross-linked, stiff filaments in order to explore the connection between the microstructure under strain and the macroscopic response of cytoskeletal networks. We find two distinct regimes as a function primarily of cross-link density and filament rigidity: one characterized by affine deformation and one by nonaffine deformation. We characterize the crossover between these two.},

Fractal analysis based on the spectral dimension is used, for the first time, to characterise fibrin gel microstructure in terms of the internal connectivity of gel networks. A significant correlation is found between the fractal characteristics of the incipient gel network and its eventual mature form, confirming that incipient gel microstructure templates ensuing gel development. We report an analytical basis for the study of this templating effect which reveals two different regimes of microstructural development. The first involves low thrombin concentration, in which increasing concentration decreases the gel formation time and alters the fractal characteristics of both incipient and mature gels. In the second regime, involving higher thrombin concentrations, the incipient gel formation time and the fractal characteristics of incipient and mature gels show little variation. The network formation is discussed in terms of computer simulations of incipient fractal networks by the activation-limited aggregation of clusters of rod-like particles. The significance of the work is discussed in terms of biomaterials design for applications involving controlled drug release and wound healing, and improved predictions of blood clot susceptibility to lysis.},

We use a dual-beam laser trap (optical stretcher) to induce temperature jumps within milliseconds, while simultaneously measuring the mechanical response of whole cells to optical force. The cellular mechanical response was found to differ between sudden temperature changes compared to slow, long-term changes implying adaptation of cytoskeletal structure. Interpreting optically induced cell deformation as a thermorheological experiment allows us to consistently explain data on the basis of time\textendash{}temperature superposition, well known from classical polymer physics. Measured time shift factors give access to the activation energy of the viscous flow of MCF-10A breast cells, which was determined to be $\approx$80 kJ mol-1. The presented measurements highlight the fundamental role that temperature plays for the deformability of cellular matter. We propose thermorheology as a powerful concept to assess the inherent material properties of living cells and to investigate cell regulatory responses upon environmental changes.},

  abstract = {The generation of robust periodic movements of complex nonlinear robotic systems is inherently difficult, especially, if parts of the robots are compliant. It has previously been proposed that complex nonlinear features of a robot, similarly as in biological organisms, might possibly facilitate its control. This bold hypothesis, commonly referred to as morphological computation, has recently received some theoretical support by Hauser et al. (Biol Cybern 105:355\textendash{}370, doi:10.1007/s00422-012-0471-0, 2012). We show in this article that this theoretical support can be extended to cover not only the case of fading memory responses to external signals, but also the essential case of autonomous generation of adaptive periodic patterns, as, e.g., needed for locomotion. The theory predicts that feedback into the morphological computing system is necessary and sufficient for such tasks, for which a fading memory is insufficient. We demonstrate the viability of this theoretical analysis through computer simulations of complex nonlinear mass\textendash{}spring systems that are trained to generate a large diversity of periodic movements by adapting the weights of a simple linear feedback device. Hence, the results of this article substantially enlarge the theoretically tractable application domain of morphological computation in robotics, and also provide new paradigms for understanding control principles of biological organisms.},

  abstract = {Analyses of study variables are frequently based on log transformations. To calculate the power for detecting the between-treatment difference in the log scale, we need an estimate of the standard deviation of the log-transformed variable. However, in many situations a literature search only provides the arithmetic means and the corresponding standard deviations. Without individual log-transformed data to directly calculate the sample standard deviation, we need alternative methods to estimate it. This paper presents methods for estimating and constructing confidence intervals for the standard deviation of a log-transformed variable given the mean and standard deviation of the untransformed variable. It also presents methods for estimating the standard deviation of change from baseline in the log scale given the means and standard deviations of the untransformed baseline value, on-treatment value and change from baseline. Simulations and examples are provided to assess the performance of these estimates. Copyright 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00069-0},
  abstract = {Amorphous solids fall into any reasonable definition of a solid. This means that it should be possible to describe amorphous solids in terms of an expansion in deviations from a well defined rigid microscopic reference frame \textemdash{} as in the Cauchy-Born lattice-dynamics of periodic crystals. The continuum limit of this microscopic expansion is a field theory \textemdash{} continuum elasticity. It follows that different types of amorphous solids can differ from each other and from crystalline solids only because of differences in the nature of their microscopic reference states. A theory of amorphous solids which implements this general point of view must satisfy two very general restrictions: (1) translation-rotation invariance of the expansion and (2) the reference state must be a stable equilibrium state. We construct such a general theory and also describe some results of its application to specific types of amorphous solids. The monograph consists of three parts.

Part I. The Cauchy-Born Theory of Solids, describes a general and explicitly translation-rotation invariant formulation of the Cauchy-Born expansion. This is done by using the fact that the translation-rotation invariant energy of a many particle system can be regarded as a function of the interparticle distances. The resulting formalism leads to local expressions for the continuum limit which can be used to derive microscopic expressions for the local elastic constants and for the stresses from the coefficients in the microscopic expansion around a specific reference state. One finds that the initial stresses in the microscopic reference state lead to special stress induced terms in the harmonic expansion whose continuum limit is the second order strain. Their effect on the bulk stability of the reference states of tenuous solids is closely analogous to the role of stresses in continuum stability theory.

Part II. The Rigidity of Floppy Bonded Networks, studies the stability of tenuous reference states. The theory developed in this section extends the standard considerations of the effect of stresses on the elastic stability of thin rods and shells to the complex internal structures which describe the bulk of solids. There is a geometric aspect. The interaction scheme of a physical model, the bond structure, defines a graph \textemdash{} the bonded network. When this network can be deformed continuously in d-dimensions even when all its bonded distances are fixed is geometrically floppy. A model which is described by such a network has a manifold of free degrees of freedom which have no rigidity for unstressed reference states. Mostly the free modes describe collective deformations of the reference state. We show that their number can be very large and that they often constitute a significant fraction of all eigenmodes. Like the bending of a thin rod these free modes are sensitive to stresses in the reference state around which one is expanding. When there are stresses they can become unstable, leading to structural buckling instabilities, or stable \textemdash{} depending on the sign of the relevant stresses. The theory of floppy networks thus allows us to study structural buckling, the bulk analog of the Euler buckling of rods and shells, and the stabilization of bulk shears by stretching which is the origin of the shear rigidity of most soft solids.

Part III. The Role of Stresses in Amorphous Solids, applies these results. The emphasis is on the stability of the reference state. We require stability against structural buckling and on the role of stresses in stabilizing the soft modes of tenuous bonding structures. The shear rigidity of rubbers and wet gel-likes is that of floppy bonded networks which are stretched. Like the shear rigidity of stretched membranes it is that of a network of stretched springs. We show that this is possible only because such solids are not rigid down to the atomic level. We discuss the stability of stressed granular packings emphasizing the fact that the packing has to be stable against structural buckling. This gives considerable insight into the internal mechanics of granular packings because it not only considers the equilibrium conditions on the individual grains but also the collective linear stability of a stressed packing. We then describe a new model of quenched glasses which emphasizes the role of the internal stresses in the glass. The essence of this model is the distinction between the molecular configuration in the quenched liquid, the ``snapshot state'' and the stable equilibrium reference state of the glass which emerges from it even for the most rapid ideal quench. We argue that structural buckling dominates the restructuring in the ideal quench and show that this predicts strong correlations between the local structure of the reference state and the internal stresses. Some of the most striking properties of glasses appear naturally in this microscopic model.},

Motivated by recent experiments on active polymer gels, we present a simple model of percolation with a highly unusual phase transition that exhibits both a discontinuous jump in the order parameter as well as critical behavior characteristic of a continuous transition. We calculate the critical exponents of this model and demonstrate that the Fisher exponent, \$$\backslash$tau\$, is smaller than the usual lower bound of \$2\$ in random percolation. This qualitatively changes the nature of the transition and leads to the unusual combination of first- and second-order signatures.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy is frequently used to study two and three dimensional network structures formed by cytoskeletal polymer fibers such as actin filaments and actin cables. While these cytoskeletal structures are often dilute enough to allow imaging of individual filaments or bundles of them, quantitative analysis of these images is challenging. To facilitate quantitative, reproducible and objective analysis of the image data, we propose a semi-automated method to extract actin networks and retrieve their topology in 3D. Our method uses multiple Stretching Open Active Contours (SOACs) that are automatically initialized at image intensity ridges and then evolve along the centerlines of filaments in the network. SOACs can merge, stop at junctions, and reconfigure with others to allow smooth crossing at junctions of filaments. The proposed approach is generally applicable to images of curvilinear networks with low SNR. We demonstrate its potential by extracting the centerlines of synthetic meshwork images, actin networks in 2D Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy images, and 3D actin cable meshworks of live fission yeast cells imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy. Quantitative evaluation of the method using synthetic images shows that for images with SNR above 5.0, the average vertex error measured by the distance between our result and ground truth is 1 voxel, and the average Hausdorff distance is below 10 voxels.},

Evaluation of proposed method has been done using optical character recognition, visual criteria, and established measures: execution time, F-measure, peak signal-to-noise ratio, negative rate metric, and information to noise difference. Our method is tested on the four types of datasets including Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) series datasets (DIBCO 2009, H-DIBCO 2010, and DIBCO 2011), which include a variety of degraded document images.

The confocal image stacks were skeletonized directly. The brightfield stacks required 3-D deconvolution. The results of skeletonization were analyzed to extract a graph representation. Topological and metric analyses can be carried out using this representation. A semiautomatic method was developed for reconnection of dendritic fragments that are disconnected due to insufficient dye penetration, an imaging deficiency, or skeletonization errors.

  abstract = {The mechanical stability and integrity of biological cells is provided by the cytoskeleton, a semidilute meshwork of biopolymers. Recent research has underscored its role as a dynamic, multifunctional muscle, whose passive and active mechanical performance is highly heterogeneous in space and time and intimately linked to many biological functions, such that it may serve as a sensitive indicator for the health or developmental state of the cell. In vitro reconstitution of 'functional modules' of the cytoskeleton is now seen as a way of balancing the mutually conflicting demands for simplicity, which is required for systematic and quantitative studies, and for a sufficient degree of complexity that allows a faithful representation of biological functions. This bottom-up strategy, aimed at unravelling biological complexity from its physical basis, builds on the latest advances in technology, experimental design and theoretical modelling, which are reviewed in this progress report.},

  abstract = {We explore the origins of slow dynamics, aging and glassy rheology in soft and living matter. Non-diffusive slow dynamics and aging in materials characterised by crowding of the constituents can be explained in terms of structural rearrangement or remodelling events that occur within the jammed state. In this context, we introduce the jamming phase diagram proposed by Liu and Nagel to understand the ergodic-nonergodic transition in these systems, and discuss recent theoretical attempts to explain the unusual, faster-than-exponential dynamical structure factors observed in jammed soft materials. We next focus on the anomalous rheology (flow and deformation behaviour) ubiquitous in soft matter characterised by metastability and structural disorder, and refer to the Soft Glassy Rheology (SGR) model that quantifies the mechanical response of these systems and predicts aging under suitable conditions. As part of a survey of experimental work related to these issues, we present x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) results of the aging of laponite clay suspensions following rejuvenation. We conclude by exploring the scientific literature for recent theoretical advances in the understanding of these models and for experimental investigations aimed at testing their predictions.},

  abstract = {The theory of critical phenomena in systems at equilibrium is reviewed at an introductory level with special emphasis on the values of the critical point exponents $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$,..., and their interrelations. The experimental observations are surveyed and the analogies between different physical systems - fluids, magnets, superfluids, binary alloys, etc. - are developed phenomenologically. An exact theoretical basis for the analogies follows from the equivalence between classical and quantal `lattice gases' and the Ising and Heisenberg-Ising magnetic models. General rigorous inequalities for critical exponents at and below Tc are derived. The nature and validity of the `classical' (phenomenological and mean field) theories are discussed, their predictions being contrasted with the exact results for plane Ising models, which are summarized concisely. Pad{\'e} approximant and ratio techniques applied to appropriate series expansions lead to precise critical-point estimates for the three-dimensional Heisenberg and Ising models (tables of data are presented). With this background a critique is presented of recent theoretical ideas: namely, the `droplet' picture of the critical point and the `homogeneity' and `scaling' hypotheses. These lead to a `law of corresponding states' near a critical point and to relations between the various exponents which suggest that perhaps only two or three exponents might be algebraically independent for any system.},

  abstract = {Biological as well as manmade materials with fibrous microstructures are ubiquitous in everyday life. At a certain length scale of observation, these materials appear in the form of a random network of cross-linked (connected) filaments. The computational effort required for investigating the mechanics of these structures by modeling the deformation of each fiber is very large. Therefore, a proper representation of their overall mechanical properties requires developing multiscale schemes capable of describing the behavior of the discrete system with a continuum model without loss of essential microstructural details. This article discusses two approaches developed for solving boundary value problems on large fiber-network domains using scale coupling techniques. We present first considerations related to sequential multiscale modeling, in particular linked to the scale of transition from a discrete to a continuum model of the network. Further, we review a method designed to construct a continuum model for the network structure, which takes into account the intrinsic spatial correlations of network properties. In both techniques, the geometrical and structural properties of network constituents at micro-scales are considered in estimating the macro-scale behavior of the structure subjected to external loads.},

Finally, the final binarization result is obtained by remedying the primary binarization result with the low-threshold binary image.

Here we show that the role of particle shape can, however, be explored efficiently when granular design is viewed in the context of artificial evolution. By introducing a mutable representation for particle shapes, we demonstrate with computer simulation how shapes can be evolved. As proof of principle, we predicted motifs that link shape to packing stiffness, discovered a particle that produces aggregates that stiffen\textemdash{}rather than weaken\textemdash{}under compression, and verified the results using three-dimensional printing. More generally, our approach facilitates the exploration of the role of arbitrary particle geometry in jammed systems, and invites the discovery and design of granular matter with optimized properties.},

The bead-spring and bead-rod models are presented, the range of their applicability discussed, and methods presented for inclusion of hydrodynamics interactions, excluded volume, and other physical effects within BD simulations. After reviewing and updating work in the linear viscoelastic regime, the primary focus shifts to the more complex nonlinear regime. While BD predictions of the conformations of 20 to 100 micron long DNA molecules in strong shear and extensional flows has been in good to excellent agreement with the corresponding experiments, predictions of the polystyrene dilute solutionrheometry data have been hit or miss, with poorer results obtained for the higher molecular weights. This may be due, in part, to the more important roles of hydrodynamic interactions and excluded volume interactions in the more flexible, and therefore more condensed, polystyrene coils. Inclusion of these effects in BD simulations has led to improved predictions, but does not lead to the accurate prediction of the plateau Trouton viscosity for higher molecular weight samples, nor alleviate the complete failure of simulations to predict measurements of coil distortion by light scattering. Thus, despite enormous progress in the past decade, some significant gaps in understanding remain.},

The externally formed gels contain parallel aligned capillary structures. The mechanical and mass transport properties and the microstructure of the differently set gels were characterized by rheological measurements, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images show a zone of distorted anisotropic gel structure in the vicinity of the capillaries as well as indications of a lower degree of void connectivity. The diffusion rates of dextran at large distances from the capillaries were fast and capillary gels showed a plastic behaviour in comparison to the internally set gels. The results presented show large functional differences between the internally and externally set gels, which cannot be explained by the presence of capillaries alone.},

  abstract = {Understanding the chemistry and physics of polymer systems challenges scientists from a wide spectrum of research areas, ranging from polymer science to molecular electronic structure theory. One of the characteristic features of polymer systems is that their physics involve a multitude of different length and time scales, which generally render the determination of their structure and physical properties on a detailed level computationally exhaustive. To overcome this difficulty, novel field-theoretic methodologies based on the mean field approximation have emerged recently and have proven to deliver useful results in the calculation of mesoscopic polymer models in the regime of high monomer concentrations. In this review we demonstrate that the field-theoretic approach is not only an useful formalism for treating highly concentrated polymer systems on the mesoscopic level of description, but that it is also a promising theoretical tool, to solve the multiscale problems arising in the calculation of physical properties of a wide variety of neutral and charged polymer materials. To this end, we show that the field-theoretic approach possesses the advantageous property to enable the treatment of all levels of description, spanning from the quantum to the continuum scale, within an unified theoretical framework. On the example of the coupling of the mesoscopic and continuum scale, we show that this specific feature constitutes a crucial advantage of field-theoretic approaches with regard to current state-of-the-art particle-based simulation methodologies for connecting different levels of description. Another major benefit relates to their favorable approximation characteristics, which permit to devise efficient approximation strategies for evaluating sophisticated polymer solution models in the low to moderate regime of monomer concentrations in a reliable way. To show this, we present novel low-cost approximation strategies beyond the mean field level of approximation using effective renormalization concepts, originating from the domain of quantum field theory, and demonstrate their usefulness in the calculation of structure and physical properties of several polymer models, described at various levels of description.},

Our model system consists of short bead-spring chains and the temperature ranges from well above the glass transition temperature to about 10\% above it. The nano-particle clearly couples to the slowing down of the polymer segments and the calculated storage and loss moduli reveal the approach to the glass transition. At temperatures close to the mode coupling T c of the polymer melt, the micro-rheological moduli measure the local viscoelastic response of the cage of monomers surrounding the nano-particle and no longer reveal the true melt moduli. The incoherent scattering function of the nano-particle exhibits a stretched exponential decay, typical for the $\alpha$-process in glass forming systems. We find no indication of a strong superdiffusive regime as has been deduced from a recent experiment in the same temperature range but for smaller momentum transfers.},

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications.},

  abstract = {Applications for porous fibrous materials range from electrochemical substrates to web reinforcement in polymeric composite materials. The details of local load transfer are studied in a class of cost-effective, stochastic fibrous networks used in battery applications, which form the substrate for a composite electrode. The connectivity of these materials is quantitatively related to modulus and strength, and detailed results of different simulations approaches in approximating material construction are discussed. In Part I, we discuss microscale assumptions, including beam type, nodal connections and equivalence of models to more physically realistic models. Simulation of large networks is computationally intensive, and show low-strain, nonlinear behavior even when comprised of elastic elements when failure criteria (here, strength-of-materials) are applied to produce sequential rupture of beams and nodes. Strategies for effective simulation of these materials requires detailed analysis of the simplest assumptions which can be made at the microscale which produce acceptably realistic response. We show that simple Euler-Bernoulli beam elements can be used to effectively model such materials, even when segment lengths in a network are very small. Moreover, connections comprised of simple torsion springs produce realistic behavior, and can mimic more realistic junctures by adaptation of the linear solution to a compliant zone model. In Part II of this work, we demonstrate the effect of model selection on full network behavior, and also discuss issues of connectivity at the scale of the porous material rather than element-by-element. This work points toward use of simple constructions to model complex behavior, and may ultimately provide insight into modeling of a large class of porous materials. [S0094-4289(00)01704-7]},

  abstract = {Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock\textendash{}paper\textendash{}scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.},

The key aspects of this approach are: (i) detection of neuronal dendrites through learning 3D tubular models, and (ii) skeletonization by a new algorithm using a morphology-guided deformable model for extracting the dendritic centerline. To represent the neuron morphology, we introduce a novel representation, the Minimum Shape-Cost (MSC) Tree that approximates the dendrite centerline with sub-voxel accuracy and demonstrate the uniqueness of such a shape representation as well as its computational efficiency. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative results that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method.},

  abstract = {We present a study of exclusion processes on networks as models for complex transport phenomena, and in particular for active transport of motor proteins along the cytoskeleton. Specifically, we focus on the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) as well as its generalizations including backstepping (partially asymmetric simple exclusion process (PASEP)) and exchange with a bulk concentration (TASEP with Langmuir kinetics (TASEP-LK)). We build on the previously used effective rate approach to establish a general methodology in terms of effective rate diagrams, which allows for a simple classification of the stationary transport state of the total network. This approach is general and reveals generic features of exclusion processes on networks. Based on the three examples considered here, we show that the classification can be made in terms of three qualitative different network regimes: a homogeneous regime, a heterogeneous network regime and a heterogeneous segment regime. Using parameters representative of real motor proteins, we show how the transitions between these regimes can be regulated through a variety of multi-scale factors, such as the interplay of exclusion interactions, the non-equilibrium nature of the transport process, motor processivity and the network topology. Using the equilibrium limits of PASEP and TASEP-LK, we also shed further light on the emergence of density heterogeneities in active transport phenomena.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0031-3203(02)00098-5},
  abstract = {The skeleton is essential for general shape representation. The commonly required properties of a skeletonization algorithm are that the extracted skeleton should be accurate; robust to noise, position and rotation; able to reconstruct the original object; and able to produce a connected skeleton in order to preserve its topological and hierarchical properties. However, the use of a discrete image presents a lot of problems that may influence the extraction of the skeleton. Moreover, most of the methods are memory-intensive and computationally intensive, and require a complex data structure.

In this paper, we propose a fast, efficient and accurate skeletonization method for the extraction of a well-connected Euclidean skeleton based on a signed sequential Euclidean distance map. A connectivity criterion is proposed, which can be used to determine whether a given pixel is a skeleton point independently. The criterion is based on a set of point pairs along the object boundary, which are the nearest contour points to the pixel under consideration and its 8 neighbors. Our proposed method generates a connected Euclidean skeleton with a single pixel width without requiring a linking algorithm or iteration process. Experiments show that the runtime of our algorithm is faster than the distance transformation and is linearly proportional to the number of pixels of an image.},

We demonstrate that the thermal equipartition of translation, rotation, and spring degrees of freedom are preserved by our formalism while simultaneously resolving the nature of the hydrodynamic correlations. Additionally, we evaluate the potential of mean force (or free energy density) along a specified reaction coordinate to facilitate extensive conformational sampling of the nanocarrier motion. We show that our results are in excellent agreement with analytical results and Monte Carlo simulations, thereby validating our methodologies. The frameworks we have presented provide a comprehensive platform for temporal multiscale modeling of hydrodynamic and microscopic interactions mediating nanocarrier motion and adhesion in vascular targeted drug delivery.},

The important role played by computer simulations in studying and understanding the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is given. The recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics is reviewed. The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, an extensive overview is given of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Non-relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated here in a different way. It is, however, mathematically equivalent to the familiar formulation. In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions, one from each alternative way. The probability that a particle will be found to have a path x(t) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of $\hslash$) for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching x, t from the past is the wave function $\psi$(x, t). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated, in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics.},

  abstract = {A goal of complex system research is to identify the dynamical implications of network structure. While early results focused mainly on local or global structural properties, there is now growing interest in mesoscale structures that comprise more than one node but not the whole network. A central challenge is to discover under what conditions the occurrence of a specific mesoscale motif already allows conclusions on the dynamics of a network as a whole. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of ecological food webs, complex heterogeneous networks of interacting populations. Generalizing the results of MacArthur and S{\'a}nchez-Garc{\'\i}a (2009 Phys. Rev. E 80 26117), we show that certain mesoscale symmetries imply the existence of localized dynamical modes. If these modes are unstable the occurrence of the corresponding mesoscale motif implies dynamical instability regardless of the structure of the embedding network. In contrast, if the mode is stable it means that the symmetry can be exploited to reduce the number of nodes in the model, without changing the dynamics of the system. This result explains a previously observed dynamical equivalence between food webs containing a different number of species.},

One such open puzzle is the observed pulses of backward-moving myosin-X in the filopodia structure. Motivated by this phenomenon we introduce two generalizations of the `total asymmetric exclusion process' (TASEP) that might be relevant to the formation of such pulses. The first is adding a nearest-neighbours attractive interaction between motors, while the second is adding an internal degree of freedom corresponding to a processive and immobile form of the motors. Switching between the two states occurs stochastically, without a conservation law. Both models show strong deviations from the mean field behaviour and lack particle\textendash{}hole symmetry. We use approximations borrowed from the research on vehicular traffic models to calculate the current and jam size distribution in a system with periodic boundary conditions and introduce a novel modification to one of these approximation schemes.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have revealed the key role of natively unfolded proteins in many important biological processes. In order to study the conformational changes of these proteins, a one-bead-per-amino-acid coarse grained (CG) model is developed, and a method is proposed to extract the potential functions for the local interactions between CG beads. Experimentally obtained Ramachandran data for the coil regions of proteins are converted into distributions of pseudo-bond and pseudo-dihedral angles between neighboring alpha-carbons in the polypeptide chain. These are then used to derive bending and torsion potentials, which are residue and sequence specific. The validity of the developed model is testified by studying the radius of gyration as well as the hydrodynamic properties of chemically denatured proteins.},

It was ascertained that two the length scales that characterize the gel network (diameter of polymer chain and typical mesh size of the gel network) can be determined quantitatively by a 3-d box-counting analysis and a 3-d Fourier transform (FT) analysis to obtain the power spectra. Turbidity measurements were employed for the determination of average fiber diameter. Self-similar structure of the gel network was found to be realized in the range between those two scales. The fibrin gels formed by larger amounts of thrombin showed a smaller fractal dimension that, deduced by the box-counting method, was in good agreement with the result from 3-d FT analysis and with a recent dynamic light scattering study (Kita R. et al. (2002) Biomacromolecules 3:1013).},

  doi = {10.1115/1.2165699},
  abstract = {The microstructure of tissues and tissue equivalents (TEs) plays a critical role in determining the mechanical properties thereof. One of the key challenges in constitutive modeling of TEs is incorporating the kinematics at both the macroscopic and the microscopic scale. Models of fibrous microstructure commonly assume fibrils to move homogeneously, that is affine with the macroscopic deformation. While intuitive for situations of fibril-matrix load transfer, the relevance of the affine assumption is less clear when primary load transfer is from fibril to fibril. The microstructure of TEs is a hydrated network of collagen fibrils, making its microstructural kinematics an open question. Numerical simulation of uniaxial extensile behavior in planar TE networks was performed with fibril kinematics dictated by the network model and by the affine model. The average fibril orientation evolved similarly with strain for both models. The individual fibril kinematics, however, were markedly different. There was no correlation between fibril strain and orientation in the network model, and fibril strains were contained by extensive reorientation. As a result, the macroscopic stress given by the network model was roughly threefold lower than the affine model. Also, the network model showed a toe region, where fibril reorientation precluded the development of significant fibril strain. We conclude that network fibril kinematics are not governed by affine principles, an important consideration in the understanding of tissue and TE mechanics, especially when load bearing is primarily by an interconnected fibril network.},

  abstract = {Collagen is the most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM), where its structural organization conveys mechanical information to cells. Using optical-tweezers-based microrheology, we investigated mechanical properties both of collagen molecules at a range of concentrations in acidic solution where fibrils cannot form and of gels of collagen fibrils formed at neutral pH, as well as the development of microscale mechanical heterogeneity during the self-assembly process. The frequency scaling of the complex shear modulus even at frequencies of $\sim$10 kHz was not able to resolve the flexibility of collagen molecules in acidic solution. In these solutions, molecular interactions cause significant transient elasticity, as we observed for 5 mg/ml solutions at frequencies above $\sim$200 Hz. We found the viscoelasticity of solutions of collagen molecules to be spatially homogeneous, in sharp contrast to the heterogeneity of self-assembled fibrillar collagen systems, whose elasticity varied by more than an order of magnitude and in power-law behavior at different locations within the sample. By probing changes in the complex shear modulus over 100-minute timescales as collagen self-assembled into fibrils, we conclude that microscale heterogeneity appears during early phases of fibrillar growth and continues to develop further during this growth phase. Experiments in which growing fibrils dislodge microspheres from an optical trap suggest that fibril growth is a force-generating process. These data contribute to understanding how heterogeneities develop during self-assembly, which in turn can help synthesis of new materials for cellular engineering.},

We demonstrate that the growth of the structures depends on the intricate balance between crosslinker-induced stabilization and simultaneous destabilization by molecular motors, a mechanism analogous to nucleation and growth in passive systems. We also show that the intricate interplay between force generation, coarsening and connectivity is responsible for the highly dynamic process of structure formation in this heterogeneous active gel, and that these competing mechanisms result in anomalous transport, reminiscent of intracellular dynamics.},

The method is tested on several images of different patterns with varying illumination and the results are compared to the ones produced by a number of adaptive thresholding algorithms. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness, the proposed method had been implemented in medical and document images. The proposed method compares favorably against those using watershed and morphology in medical image and favorably against variable threshold and adaptive Otsu's N-thresholding for document image.},

  abstract = {The major challenge in biology today is biocomplexity: the need to explain how cell and tissue behaviors emerge from collective interactions within complex molecular networks. Part I of this two-part article, described a mechanical model of cell structure based on tensegrity architecture that explains how the mechanical behavior of the cell emerges from physical interactions among the different molecular filament systems that form the cytoskeleton. Recent work shows that the cytoskeleton also orients much of the cell's metabolic and signal transduction machinery and that mechanical distortion of cells and the cytoskeleton through cell surface integrin receptors can profoundly affect cell behavior. In particular, gradual variations in this single physical control parameter (cell shape distortion) can switch cells between distinct gene programs (e.g. growth, differentiation and apoptosis), and this process can be viewed as a biological phase transition. Part II of this article covers how combined use of tensegrity and solid-state mechanochemistry by cells may mediate mechanotransduction and facilitate integration of chemical and physical signals that are responsible for control of cell behavior. In addition, it examines how cell structural networks affect gene and protein signaling networks to produce characteristic phenotypes and cell fate transitions during tissue development.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we compare the interactions between low methoxy pectin (LMP) and either Ca2+ or Zn2+ in semi-dilute solutions. Intrinsic viscosity and turbidity measurements reveal that pectin\textendash{}calcium solutions are more viscous, but yet less turbid, than pectin\textendash{}zinc ones. To get a molecular understanding of the origin of this rather unexpected behavior, we further performed isothermal titration calorimetry, small angle neutron scattering experiments, as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Our results suggest that calcium cations induce the formation of a more homogeneous network of pectin than zinc cations do. The molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this difference could originate from the way the two cations bind to the galacturonate unit (Gal), the main component of LMP: zinc interacts with both carboxylate and hydroxyl groups of Gal, in a similar way to that described in the so-called egg-box model, whereas calcium only interacts with carboxylate groups. This different binding behavior seems to arise from the stronger interaction of water molecules with zinc than with calcium. Accordingly, galacturonate chains are more loosely associated with each other in the presence of Ca2+ than with Zn2+. This may improve their ability to form a gel, not only by dimerization, but also by the formation of point-like cross-links. Overall, our results show that zinc binds less easily to pectin than calcium does.},

  abstract = {Network formation of associative semiflexible fibers and mixtures of fibers and colloidal particles is simulated for the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model of elastic contacts, and a phase diagram in terms of particle elasticity and surface energy is presented. When fibers self-assemble, they form a network for sufficiently large fiber-solvent surface energy. If the surface energy is above the value where single particles crystallize, the adhesion forces drive diffusion-limited aggregation. Two mechanisms contribute to coarsening: non-associated chains joining existing bundles, and fiber bundles merging. Coarsening stops when the length of the network connections is roughly the persistence length, independent of surface energy. If the surface energy is below the value where single particles crystallize, a network can still be formed but at a much slower (reaction limited) rate. Loose (liquid-like) assemblies between chains form when they happen to run more-or-less parallel. These assemblies grow by diffusion and aggregation and form a loose network, which sets in micro-phase separation, i.e., syneresis. Only when the clusters crystallize, the coarsening process stops. In this case, the length of the network connections is larger than the persistence length of a single chain, and depends on the value of the surface energy. All networks of semiflexible homopolymers in this study show syneresis. Mixtures of fibers and colloid particles also form fiber bundle networks, but by choosing the colloid volume fraction sufficiently low, swelling gels are obtained. Applications of this model are in biological systems where fibers self-assemble into cell walls and bone tissue.},

Recent measurements have shown that many gelled biopolymer materials display slow dynamics on timescales greater than one second, that are not accessible with typical methods, and are characteristic of glassy trapped systems. In this study we have controlled the fine structure of the anionic polysaccharide pectin in order to construct a series of ionotropic gels having differing binding energies between the constituent chains, in an attempt to further understand the slow dynamical processes occurring. Using multi-speckle light scattering techniques it is shown that the slow dynamics observed in these gelled systems are stress-driven. As the binding lengths, and thus the binding energies, of the junction zones between the polymer chains in these networks increase the long-time dynamics initially slow, as might be expected, until a critical level of internal stress is reached upon which the dynamics increase significantly, with gentle creaking punctuated by localised stress-relieving quakes.},

  abstract = {Stiff polymers, such as single-stranded DNA, unstructured RNA and cellulose, are all basically extremely long rods with relatively short repeating monomers. The simplest model for describing such stiff polymers is called the freely jointed chain model, which treats a molecule as a chain of perfectly rigid subunits of orientationally independent statistical segments, joined together by perfectly flexible hinges. A more realistic model that incorporates the entropic elasticity of a molecule, called the worm-like chain model, has been proposed by assuming that each monomer resists the bending force. Some force-extension formulae for the worm-like chain model have been previously found in terms of interpolation and numerical solutions resulting from statistical mechanics. In this paper, however, we adopt a variational principle to seek the minimum energy configuration of a stretched molecule by incorporating all the possible orientations of each monomer under thermal equilibrium, i.e., constant temperature. We determine a force-extension formula for the worm-like chain model analytically. We find that our formula suggests new terms such as the free energy and the cut-off force of a molecule, which define a clear transition from the entropic regime to the enthalpic regime and the fracture of the molecule, respectively. In addition, we predict two possible phase changes for a stretched molecule, i.e., from a super-helix to a soliton and then from a soliton to a vertical twisted line. We show theoretically that a molecule must undergo at least one phase change before it is fully stretched into its total contour length. This new formula is used to fit recent experimental data and shows a good agreement with some current literature that uses a statistical approach. Finally, an instability analysis is adopted to investigate the sensitivity of the new formula subject to small changes in temperature.},

great challenge, with an impact that ranges from industrial applications to fundamental
issues in modern statistical physics, such as the glass transition and the description of
out-of-equilibrium systems. Although our understanding of these phenomena is still far
from complete, recent simulations and novel theoretical approaches and experimental
methods have shed new light on the dynamics of soft glassy materials. In this paper,
we review the work of the last few years, with an emphasis on experiments in four
distinct and yet related areas: the existence of two different glass states (attractive
and repulsive), the dynamics of systems very far from equilibrium, the effect of an
external perturbation on glassy materials, and dynamical heterogeneity.},

Such geometries therefore represent a deformed configuration stressed by typical in vivo conditions. Commonly, such structures are considered stress free in simulation. In this contribution we present and compare two methods to introduce a physically meaningful stress/strain state to the obtained geometry for simulations in the finite strain regime and demonstrate the necessity of such prestressing techniques. One method is based on an inverse design analysis to calculate a stress-free reference configuration. The other method developed here is based on a modified updated Lagrangian formulation. The formulation of both methods is provided in detail and implementation issues are discussed. Applicability and accurateness of both approaches are compared and evaluated utilizing an analytical aorta model and fully three-dimensional patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm structures in the finite strain regime.

  abstract = {This study describes the viscoelastic properties of a refined cellular-tensegrity model composed of six rigid bars connected to a continuous network of 24 viscoelastic pre-stretched cables (Voigt bodies) in order to analyse the role of the cytoskeleton spatial rearrangement on the viscoelastic response of living adherent cells. This structural contribution was determined from the relationships between the global viscoelastic properties of the tensegrity model, i.e., normalized viscosity modulus ($\eta$*), normalized elasticity modulus (E*), and the physical properties of the constitutive elements, i.e., their normalized length (L*) and normalized initial internal tension (T*). We used a numerical method to simulate the deformation of the structure in response to different types of loading, while varying by several orders of magnitude L* and T*. The numerical results obtained reveal that $\eta$* remains almost independent of changes in T* ($\eta$*$\propto$T*+0.1), whereas E* increases with approximately the square root of the internal tension T* (from E*$\propto$T*+0.3 to E*$\propto$T*+0.7). Moreover, structural viscosity $\eta$* and elasticity E* are both inversely proportional to the square of the size of the structure ($\eta$*$\propto$L*-2 and E*$\propto$L*-2). These structural properties appear consistent with cytoskeleton (CSK) mechanical properties measured experimentally by various methods which are specific to the CSK micromanipulation in living adherent cells. Present results suggest, for the first time, that the effect of structural rearrangement of CSK elements on global CSK behavior is characterized by a faster cellular mechanical response relatively to the CSK element response, which thus contributes to the solidification process observed in adherent cells. In extending to the viscoelastic properties the analysis of the mechanical response of the cellular 30-element tensegrity model, the present study contributes to the understanding of recent results on the cellular-dynamic response and allows to reunify the scattered data reported for the viscoelastic properties of living adherent cells.},

  abstract = {The blood vessels and nerve trees consist of tubular objects interconnected into a complex tree- or web-like structure that has a range of structural scale 5\,$\mu$m diameter capillaries to 3\,cm aorta. This large-scale range presents two major problems; one is just making the measurements, and the other is the exponential increase of component numbers with decreasing scale. With the remarkable increase in the volume imaged by, and resolution of, modern day 3D imagers, it is almost impossible to make manual tracking of the complex multiscale parameters from those large image data sets. In addition, the manual tracking is quite subjective and unreliable. We propose a solution for automation of an adaptive nonsupervised system for tracking tubular objects based on multiscale framework and use of Hessian-based object shape detector incorporating National Library of Medicine Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) image processing libraries.},

  abstract = {Mechanical force plays an important role in the physiology of eukaryotic cells whose dominant structural constituent is the actin cytoskeleton composed mainly of actin and actin crosslinking proteins (ACPs). Thus, knowledge of rheological properties of actin networks is crucial for understanding the mechanics and processes of cells. We used Brownian dynamics simulations to study the viscoelasticity of crosslinked actin networks. Two methods were employed, bulk rheology and segment-tracking rheology, where the former measures the stress in response to an applied shear strain, and the latter analyzes thermal fluctuations of individual actin segments of the network. It was demonstrated that the storage shear modulus (G${'}$) increases more by the addition of ACPs that form orthogonal crosslinks than by those that form parallel bundles. In networks with orthogonal crosslinks, as crosslink density increases, the power law exponent of G${'}$ as a function of the oscillation frequency decreases from 0.75, which reflects the transverse thermal motion of actin filaments, to near zero at low frequency. Under increasing prestrain, the network becomes more elastic, and three regimes of behavior are observed, each dominated by different mechanisms: bending of actin filaments, bending of ACPs, and at the highest prestrain tested (55\%), stretching of actin filaments and ACPs. In the last case, only a small portion of actin filaments connected via highly stressed ACPs support the strain. We thus introduce the concept of a `supportive framework,' as a subset of the full network, which is responsible for high elasticity. Notably, entropic effects due to thermal fluctuations appear to be important only at relatively low prestrains and when the average crosslinking distance is comparable to or greater than the persistence length of the filament. Taken together, our results suggest that viscoelasticity of the actin network is attributable to different mechanisms depending on the amount of prestrain., The actin cytoskeleton provides structural integrity to a cell, is highly dynamic, and plays a central role in a wide variety of phenomena such as migration and the sensation of external forces. For years, researchers have studied the mechanics of the cytoskeleton by creating actin gels in the laboratory in combination with proteins that bridge between and reinforce the actin gel found inside cells. These gels, however, failed to replicate many aspects of cell behavior. Recent studies have shown that tension within the cytoskeleton contributes to the observed stiffness of cells. Still, our understanding of cytoskeletal mechanics is incomplete, and many observed phenomena cannot be explained by existing models. Here, we simulate a three-dimensional network containing actin filaments linked together by other proteins. We studied the relative contributions of thermal fluctuations of the network and the stiffness of filaments and linking proteins. Under conditions that replicate those in a cell, properties of the linking proteins are surprisingly significant, as is the stiffness of the actin filament to stretching. Thermal fluctuations are relatively unimportant, but become more so at low levels of resting tension. At high tensions, a small fraction of filaments support a majority of the load.},

  abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

These networks exhibit a rich set of remarkable mechanical properties, but a detailed picture relating the microscopic mechanics of the individual fibers to the overall network properties has not been fully developed. In particular, how the high strain and failure characteristics of single fibers affect the overall strength of the network is not known. Using a combined fluorescence/atomic force microscope nanomanipulation system, we stretched 2-D fibrin networks to the point of failure, while recording the strain of individual fibers. Our results were compared to a pair of model networks: one composed of linearly responding elements and a second of nonlinear, strain-stiffening elements. We find that strain-stiffening of the individual fibers is necessary to explain the pattern of strain propagation throughout the network that we observe in our experiments. Fiber strain-stiffening acts to distribute strain more equitably within the network, reduce strain maxima, and increase network strength. Along with its physiological implications, a detailed understanding of this strengthening mechanism may lead to new design strategies for engineered polymeric materials.},

A general feature of such systems, well documented yet not really understood, is the strongly nonlinear nature of the flow rule relating stresses and strain rates. Here we use a microfluidic velocimetry technique to characterize the flow of thin layers of concentrated emulsions, confined in gaps of different thicknesses by surfaces of different roughnesses. We find evidence for finite-size effects in the flow behaviour and the absence of an intrinsic local flow rule. In contrast to the classical nonlinearities of the rheological behaviour of amorphous materials, we show that a rather simple non-local flow rule can account for all the velocity profiles. This non-locality of the dynamics is quantified by a length, characteristic of cooperativity within the flow at these scales, that is unobservable in the liquid state (lower emulsion concentrations) and that increases with concentration in the jammed state. Beyond its practical importance for applications involving thin layers (for example, coatings), these non-locality and cooperativity effects have parallels in the behaviour of other glassy, jammed and granular systems, suggesting a possible fundamental universality.},

In this paper we explore acceleration of the image registration package elastix by a combination of several techniques: (i) parallelization on the CPU, to speed up the cost function derivative calculation; (ii) parallelization on the GPU building on and extending the OpenCL framework from ITKv4, to speed up the Gaussian pyramid computation and the image resampling step; (iii) exploitation of certain properties of the B-spline transformation model; (iv) further software optimizations. The accelerated registration tool is employed in a study on diagnostic classification of Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls based on T1-weighted MRI. We selected 299 participants from the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Classification is performed with a support vector machine based on gray matter volumes as a marker for atrophy. We evaluated two types of strategies (voxel-wise and region-wise) that heavily rely on nonrigid image registration. Parallelization and optimization resulted in an acceleration factor of 4\textendash{}5x on an 8-core machine. Using OpenCL a speedup factor of 2 was realized for computation of the Gaussian pyramids, and 15\textendash{}60 for the resampling step, for larger images. The voxel-wise and the region-wise classification methods had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 88 and 90\%, respectively, both for standard and accelerated registration. We conclude that the image registration package elastix was substantially accelerated, with nearly identical results to the non-optimized version. The new functionality will become available in the next release of elastix as open source under the BSD license.},

We show that these two previously introduced notions can be retrieved, better understood and enriched in the framework of critical kernels. In particular, we propose new characterizations which hold in dimensions 2, 3 and 4, and which lead to efficient algorithms for detecting P-simple points and minimal non-simple sets.},

We compare our new curve thinning algorithm with all the published algorithms of the same kind, based on quantitative criteria. Our experiments show that our algorithm largely outperforms the other ones with respect to noise sensitivity. Furthermore, we show how to slightly modify our algorithms to include a filtering parameter that controls effectively the pruning of skeletons, based on the notion of isthmus persistence.},

Steerable filters may be designed in quadrature pairs to allow adaptive control over phase as well as orientation. The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters},

ponents,  and  then  study  each  component  with  a  resolution  matched  to  its  scale.   They  have  ad-
vantages over traditional Fourier methods in analyzing physical situations where the signal contains
discontinuities and sharp spikes.  Wavelets were developed independently in the {\O}elds of mathemat-

during  the  last  ten  years  have  led  to  many  new
wavelet  applications  such  as  image  compression,
turbulence, human vision, radar, and earthquake prediction.  This paper introduces
wavelets to the
interested technical person outside of the digital signal processing {\O}eld.  I describe the history of
wavelets beginning with Fourier, compare
wavelet transforms with Fourier transforms, state prop-
erties and other special aspects of
wavelets,  and {\O}nish with some interesting applications such as
image compression, musical tones, and de-noising noisy data},

  abstract = {Wavelet theory had its origin in quantum field theory, signal analysis, and function space theory. In these areas wavelet-like algorithms replace the classical Fourier-type expansion of a function. This unique new book is an excellent introduction to the basic properties of wavelets, from background math to powerful applications. The authors provide elementary methods for constructing wavelets, and illustrate several new classes of wavelets. The text begins with a description of local sine and cosine bases that have been shown to be very effective in applications. Very little mathematical background is needed to follow this material. A complete treatment of band-limited wavelets follows. These are characterized by some elementary equations, allowing the authors to introduce many new wavelets. Next, the idea of multiresolution analysis (MRA) is developed, and the authors include simplified presentations of previous studies, particularly for compactly supported wavelets.Some of the topics treated include:Several bases generated by a single function via translations and dilationsMultiresolution analysis, compactly supported wavelets, and spline waveletsBand-limited waveletsUnconditionality of wavelet basesCharacterizations of many of the principal objects in the theory of wavelets, such as low-pass filters and scaling functionsThe authors also present the basic philosophy that all orthonormal wavelets are completely characterized by two simple equations, and that most properties and constructions of wavelets can be developed using these two equations. Material related to applications is provided, and constructions of splines wavelets are presented. Mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and anyone with a mathematical background will find this to be an important text for furthering their studies on wavelets.},

The opening chapter provides an overview of the main problems presented in the book. Following chapters discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of wavelet theory, including wavelet transforms, orthonormal bases of wavelets, and characterization of functional spaces by means of wavelets. The last chapter presents several topics under active research, as multidimensional wavelets, wavelet packet bases, and a construction of wavelets tailored to decompose functions defined in a finite interval.},

  abstract = {The Revolt of the Masses (Spanish: La rebeli{\'o}n de las masas) is a book by Jos{\'e} Ortega y Gasset. It was first published as a series of articles in the newspaper El Sol in 1929 and as a book in 1930; the English translation, first published two years later, was authorized by Ortega. While the published version notes that the translator requested to remain anonymous, more recent editions also record that its US copyright was renewed in 1960 by a Teresa Carey, and the US Copyright Office's published list of US copyright renewals for January 1960 gives the translator as J. R. Carey.
A second translation was published in 1985 by the University of Notre Dame Press in association with W.W. Norton and Co. This translation was completed by Anthony Kerrigan (translator) and Kenneth Moore (editor). An introduction was written by novelist Saul Bellow.
In this work, Ortega traces the genesis of the "mass-man" and analyzes his constitution en route to describing the rise to power and action of the masses in society. Ortega is throughout quite critical of both the masses and the mass-men of which they are made up, contrasting "noble life and common life" and excoriating the barbarism and primitivism he sees in the mass-man. He does not, however, refer to specific social classes, as has been so commonly misunderstood in the English-speaking world. Ortega states that the mass-man could be from any social background, but his specific target is the bourgeois educated man, the se{\~n}orito satisfecho (satisfied young man or Mr. Satisfied), the specialist who believes he has it all and extends the command he has of his subject to others, contemptuous of his ignorance in all of them. Ortega's summary of what he attempted in the book exemplifies this quite well, while simultaneously providing the author's own views on his work: "In this essay an attempt has been made to sketch a certain type of European, mainly by analyzing his behaviour as regards the very civilization into which he was born". This had to be done because that individual "does not represent a new civilisation struggling with a previous one, but a mere negation ..."},

  abstract = {Fingerprint recognition plays an important role in many commercial applications and is used by millions of people every day, e.g. for unlocking mobile phones. Fingerprint image segmentation is typically the first processing step of most fingerprint algorithms and it divides an image into foreground, the region of interest, and background. Two types of error can occur during this step which both have a negative impact on the recognition performance: `true' foreground can be labeled as background and features like minutiae can be lost, or conversely `true' background can be misclassified as foreground and spurious features can be introduced. The contribution of this paper is threefold: firstly, we propose a novel factorized directional bandpass (FDB) segmentation method for texture extraction based on the directional Hilbert transform of a Butterworth bandpass (DHBB) filter interwoven with soft-thresholding. Secondly, we provide a manually marked ground truth segmentation for 10560 images as an evaluation benchmark. Thirdly, we conduct a systematic performance comparison between the FDB method and four of the most often cited fingerprint segmentation algorithms showing that the FDB segmentation method clearly outperforms these four widely used methods. The benchmark and the implementation of the FDB method are made publicly available.},

  abstract = {A crucial component of steerable wavelets is the radial profile of the generating function in the frequency domain. In this paper, we present an infinite-dimensional optimization scheme that helps us find the optimal profile for a given criterion over the space of tight frames. We consider two classes of criteria that measure the localization of the wavelet. The first class specifies the spatial localization of the wavelet profile, and the second that of the resulting wavelet coefficients. From these metrics and the proposed algorithm, we construct tight wavelet frames that are optimally localized and provide their analytical expression. In particular, one of the considered criterion helps us finding back the popular Simoncelli wavelet profile. Finally, the investigation of local orientation estimation, image reconstruction from detected contours in the wavelet domain, and denoising indicate that optimizing wavelet localization improves the performance of steerable wavelets, since our new wavelets outperform the traditional ones.},

We choose the 3-chain constitutive model of network elasticity over several plausible candidates, and derive analytical expressions for the elastic energy at arbitrary strain, with the corresponding stress\textendash{}strain relationship. The theory fits well to a wide range of experimental data on simple shear in different filament networks, quantitatively matching the differential shear modulus variation with stress, with only two adjustable parameters (which represent the filament stiffness and the pre-tension in the network, respectively). The general theory accurately describes the crossover between the positive and negative Poynting effect (normal stress on imposed shear) on increasing the stiffness of filaments forming the network. We discuss the network stability (the point of marginal rigidity) and the phenomenon of tensegrity, showing that filament pre-tension on crosslinking into the network determines the magnitude of linear modulus G0.},

Despite widespread consequences for human health, the economy and the environment, events leading to loss of resilience\textemdash{}from cascading failures in technological systems to mass extinctions in ecological networks\textemdash{}are rarely predictable and are often irreversible. These limitations are rooted in a theoretical gap: the current analytical framework of resilience is designed to treat low-dimensional models with a few interacting components, and is unsuitable for multi-dimensional systems consisting of a large number of components that interact through a complex network. Here we bridge this theoretical gap by developing a set of analytical tools with which to identify the natural control and state parameters of a multi-dimensional complex system, helping us derive effective one-dimensional dynamics that accurately predict the system's resilience. The proposed analytical framework allows us systematically to separate the roles of the system's dynamics and topology, collapsing the behaviour of different networks onto a single universal resilience function. The analytical results unveil the network characteristics that can enhance or diminish resilience, offering ways to prevent the collapse of ecological, biological or economic systems, and guiding the design of technological systems resilient to both internal failures and environmental changes.},

ITK is a templated C++ library of image processing algorithms and frameworks for biomedical and other applications, and it was designed to be generic, flexible and extensible. Initially, ITK provided a direct wrapping interface to languages such as Python and Tcl through the WrapITK system. Unlike WrapITK, which exposed ITK's complex templated interface, SimpleITK was designed to provide an easy to use and simplified interface to ITK's algorithms. It includes procedural methods, hides ITK's demand driven pipeline, and provides a template-less layer. Also SimpleITK provides practical conveniences such as binary distribution packages and overloaded operators. Our user-friendly design goals dictated a departure from the direct interface wrapping approach of WrapITK, toward a new facade class structure that only exposes the required functionality, hiding ITK's extensive template use. Internally SimpleITK utilizes a manual description of each filter with code-generation and advanced C++ meta-programming to provide the higher-level interface, bringing the capabilities of ITK to a wider audience.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that hierarchy evolves as a result of the costs of network connections. We confirm a previous finding that connection costs drive the evolution of modularity, and show that they also cause the evolution of hierarchy. We further confirm that hierarchy promotes evolvability in addition to evolvability caused by modularity. Because many biological and human-made phenomena can be represented as networks, and because hierarchy is a critical network property, this finding is immediately relevant to a wide array of fields, from biology, sociology, and medical research to harnessing evolution for engineering.},

The goal of this paper is to build optimal junction detectors based on 2D steerable wavelets that are polar-separable in the Fourier domain. The approaches we develop are general and can be used for the detection of arbitrary symmetric and asymmetric junctions. The backbone of our construction is a multiscale pyramid with a radial wavelet function where the directional components are represented by circular harmonics and encoded in a shaping matrix. We are able to detect M-fold junctions in different scales and orientations. We provide experimental results on both simulated and real data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {The richness of natural images makes the quest for optimal representations in image processing and computer vision challenging. The latter observation has not prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between efficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions as well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones, proposed in the past decade, share a hybrid heritage highlighting the multiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper presents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in multiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit redundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its invariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation, rotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet processing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries require specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse) representation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric decompositions to non-Euclidean domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed surfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of partially overlapping ``pictures''. We hope that this paper will contribute to the appreciation and apprehension of a stream of current research directions in image understanding.},

Despite its relevance, no general theory that captures all features of hierarchy and its origins has been proposed yet. Here we present a formal approach resulting from the convergence of theoretical morphology and network theory that allows constructing a 3D morphospace of hierarchies and hence comparing the hierarchical organization of ecological, cellular, technological, and social networks. Embedded within large voids in the morphospace of all possible hierarchies, four major groups are identified. Two of them match the expected from random networks with similar connectivity, thus suggesting that nonadaptive factors are at work. Ecological and gene networks define the other two, indicating that their topological order is the result of functional constraints. These results are consistent with an exploration of the morphospace, using in silico evolved networks.},

First, it generalizes the minimal length K-regular 2-band wavelets of Daubechies (1988) to the M-band case by deriving explicit formulas for K-regular M-band scaling filters. Several equivalent characterizations of K-regularity are given and their significance explained. Second, two approaches to the construction of the (M-1) wavelet filters and associated wavelet bases are described; one relies on a state-space characterization with a novel technique to obtain the unitary wavelet filters; the other uses a factorization approach. Third, this paper gives a set of necessary and sufficient condition on the M-band scaling filter for it to generate an orthonormal wavelet basis. The conditions are very similar to those obtained by Cohen (1990) and Lawton (1990) for 2-band wavelets},

In this paper, discrete wavelet transform has been adopted in order to enhance the reliability of optical flow estimation. A generalization of the well-known dyadic orthonormal wavelets to the case of the dilation scale factor M $>$ 2 with N vanishing moments has been used, and it has proved to be a useful regularizing tool.

  abstract = {Future cosmological surveys will provide 3D large scale structure maps with large sky coverage, for which a 3D Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) analysis in spherical coordinates is natural. Wavelets are particularly well-suited to the analysis and denoising of cosmological data, but a spherical 3D isotropic wavelet transform does not currently exist to analyse spherical 3D data. The aim of this paper is to present a new formalism for a spherical 3D isotropic wavelet, i.e. one based on the SFB decomposition of a 3D field and accompany the formalism with a public code to perform wavelet transforms. We describe a new 3D isotropic spherical wavelet decomposition based on the undecimated wavelet transform (UWT) described in Starck et al. 2006. We also present a new fast Discrete Spherical Fourier-Bessel Transform (DSFBT) based on both a discrete Bessel Transform and the HEALPIX angular pixelisation scheme. We test the 3D wavelet transform and as a toy-application, apply a denoising algorithm in wavelet space to the Virgo large box cosmological simulations and find we can successfully remove noise without much loss to the large scale structure. We have described a new spherical 3D isotropic wavelet transform, ideally suited to analyse and denoise future 3D spherical cosmological surveys, which uses a novel Discrete Spherical Fourier-Bessel Transform. We illustrate its potential use for denoising using a toy model. All the algorithms presented in this paper are available for download as a public code called MRS3D at http://jstarck.free.fr/mrs3d.html},

  abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of orthogonal wavelet transforms is their lack of translation invariance: the content of wavelet subbands is unstable under translations of the input signal. Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated.$<$$>$},

We show that the signature equals zero at sufficiently regular points of a signal whereas at salient features, such as jumps or cusps, it is non-zero. At such feature points, the orientation of the signature in the complex plane can be interpreted as an indicator of local symmetry and antisymmetry. We establish that the signature rotates in the complex plane under fractional Hilbert transforms. We show that certain random signals, such as white Gaussian noise and Brownian motions, have a vanishing signature. We derive an appropriate discretization and show the applicability to signal analysis.},

  abstract = {We introduce a complete parameterization of the family of two-dimensional steerable wavelets that are polar-separable in the Fourier domain under the constraint of self-reversibility. These wavelets are constructed by multiorder generalized Riesz transformation of a primary isotropic bandpass pyramid. The backbone of the transform (pyramid) is characterized by a radial frequency profile function \$h($\backslash$omega)\$, while the directional wavelet components at each scale are encoded by an \$M $\backslash$times (2N+1)\$ shaping matrix \$\{$\backslash$bf U\}\$, where \$M\$ is the number of wavelet channels and \$N\$ the order of the Riesz transform. We provide general conditions on \$h($\backslash$omega)\$ and \$\{$\backslash$bf U\}\$ for the underlying wavelet system to form a tight frame of \$L\_2($\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\^2)\$ (with a redundancy factor \$4/3M\$). The proposed framework ensures that the wavelets are steerable and provides new degrees of freedom (shaping matrix \$\{$\backslash$bf U\}\$) that can be exploited for designing specific wavelet systems. It encompasses many known transforms as particular cases: Simoncelli's steerable pyramid, Marr gradient and Hessian wavelets, monogenic wavelets, and \$N\$th-order Riesz and circular harmonic wavelets. We take advantage of the framework to construct new generalized spheroidal prolate wavelets, whose angular selectivity is maximized, as well as signal-adapted detectors based on principal component analysis. We also introduce a curvelet-like steerable wavelet system. Finally, we illustrate the advantages of some of the designs for signal denoising, feature extraction, pattern analysis, and source separation.},

  doi = {10.1109/78.960432},
  abstract = {The construction of Gabor's (1946) complex signal-which is also known as the analytic signal-provides direct access to a real one-dimensional (1-D) signal's local amplitude and phase. The complex signal is built from a real signal by adding its Hilbert transform-which is a phase-shifted version of the signal-as an imaginary part to the signal. Since its introduction, the complex signal has become an important tool in signal processing, with applications, for example, in narrowband communication. Different approaches to an n-D analytic or complex signal have been proposed in the past. We review these approaches and propose the hypercomplex signal as a novel extension of the complex signal to n-D. This extension leads to a new definition of local phase, which reveals information on the intrinsic dimensionality of the signal. The different approaches are unified by expressing all of them as combinations of the signal and its partial and total Hilbert transforms. Examples that clarify how the approaches differ in their definitions of local phase and amplitude are shown. An example is provided for the two-dimensional (2-D) hypercomplex signal, which shows how the novel phase concept can be used in texture segmentation},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional computerized characterization of biomedical solid textures is key to large-scale and high-throughput screening of imaging data. Such data increasingly become available in the clinical and research environments with an ever increasing spatial resolution. In this text we exhaustively analyze the state-of-the-art in 3-D biomedical texture analysis to identify the specific needs of the application domains and extract promising trends in image processing algorithms. The geometrical properties of biomedical textures are studied both in their natural space and on digitized lattices. It is found that most of the tissue types have strong multi-scale directional properties, that are well captured by imaging protocols with high resolutions and spherical spatial transfer functions. The information modeled by the various image processing techniques is analyzed and visualized by displaying their 3-D texture primitives. We demonstrate that non-convolutional approaches are expected to provide best results when the size of structures are inferior to five voxels. For larger structures, it is shown that only multi-scale directional convolutional approaches that are non-separable allow for an unbiased modeling of 3-D biomedical textures. With the increase of high-resolution isotropic imaging protocols in clinical routine and research, these models are expected to best leverage the wealth of 3-D biomedical texture analysis in the future. Future research directions and opportunities are proposed to efficiently model personalized image-based phenotypes of normal biomedical tissue and its alterations. The integration of the clinical and genomic context is expected to better explain the intra class variation of healthy biomedical textures. Using texture synthesis, this provides the exciting opportunity to simulate and visualize texture atlases of normal ageing process and disease progression for enhanced treatment planning and clinical care management.},

The LOIDs are key for visual understanding, and are at the origin of the success of the popular approaches such as local binary patterns (LBP) and the scaleinvariant feature transform (SIFT). Whereas LBPs and SIFT yield handcrafted image representations, we propose to learn dataspecific representations of the LOIDs in a rotation-invariant fashion. The image operators are based on steerable circular harmonic wavelets (CHW), offering a rich and yet compact initial representation for characterizing natural textures. The joint location and orientation required to encode the LOIDs is preserved by using moving frames (MF) texture representations built from locally-steered image gradients that are invariant to rigid motions. In a second step, we use support vector machines to learn a multi-class shaping matrix for the initial CHW representation, yielding data-driven MFs called steerable wavelet machines (SWM). The SWM forward function is composed of linear operations (i.e., convolution and weighted combinations) interleaved with non-linear steermax operations. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed operators for classifying natural textures. Our scheme outperforms recent approaches on several test suites of the Outex and CUReT databases.},

In particular, the derived wavelets can be ``dilated'' by a procedure comparable to the operation of steering steerable wavelets. The fundamental aspects of the construction are the same: an admissible collection of Fourier multipliers is used to extend a tight wavelet frame, and the ``scale'' of the wavelets is adapted by scaling the multipliers.  As an application, the proposed wavelets can be used to improve the frequency localization. Importantly, the localized frequency bands specified by this construction can be scaled efficiently using matrix multiplication.},

This wavelet construction is a particular case of general atomic frame decompositions of L^2(R^d) developed in this article, that allow other time frequency decompositions such as non-harmonic Gabor frames with non-uniform covering of the Euclidean space R^d. Possible applications include image and video compression, speech coding, image and digital data transmission, image analysis, estimations and detection, and seismology.},

The wavelet transform is assumed to be orthonormal and the shrinkage function minimizes the mean-square approximation error (MMSE estimator). We derive the corresponding formula for the expected value of the averaged estimation error. We show that the predicted MMSE is a monotone function of a simple criterion that depends on the wavelet and the statistical parameters of the process. Using the calculus of variations, we then optimize this criterion to find the best performing wavelet within the extended family of Meyer wavelets, which are bandlimited. These are compared to the Daubechies wavelets, which are compactly supported in time. We find that the wavelets that are shorter in time (in particular, the Haar basis) are better suited to denoise the sparser processes (say, $<$ 1:2), while the bandlimited ones (including the Held and Shannon wavelets) offer the best performance for $>$ 1:6, the limit corresponding to the Gaussian case (fBm) with = 2.},

  abstract = {Singular integrals are among the most interesting and important objects of study in analysis, one of the three main branches of mathematics. They deal with real and complex numbers and their functions. In this book, Princeton professor Elias Stein, a leading mathematical innovator as well as a gifted expositor, produced what has been called the most influential mathematics text in the last thirty-five years. One reason for its success as a text is its almost legendary presentation: Stein takes arcane material, previously understood only by specialists, and makes it accessible even to beginning graduate students. Readers have reflected that when you read this book, not only do you see that the greats of the past have done exciting work, but you also feel inspired that you can master the subject and contribute to it yourself.  Singular integrals were known to only a few specialists when Stein's book was first published. Over time, however, the book has inspired a whole generation of researchers to apply its methods to a broad range of problems in many disciplines, including engineering, biology, and finance.  Stein has received numerous awards for his research, including the Wolf Prize of Israel, the Steele Prize, and the National Medal of Science. He has published eight books with Princeton, including Real Analysis in 2005.},

  abstract = {Early vision algorithms often have a first stage of linear-filtering that `extracts' from the image information at multiple scales of resolution and multiple orientations. A common difficulty in the design and implementation of such schemes is that one feels compelled to discretize coarsely the space of scales and orientations in order to reduce computation and storage costs. A technique is presented that allows: 1) computing the best approximation of a given family using linear combinations of a small number of `basis' functions; and 2) describing all finite-dimensional families, i.e., the families of filters for which a finite dimensional representation is possible with no error. The technique is based on singular value decomposition and may be applied to generating filters in arbitrary dimensions and subject to arbitrary deformations. The relevant functional analysis results are reviewed and precise conditions for the decomposition to be feasible are stated. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the applicability of the technique to generating multiorientation multi-scale 2D edge-detection kernels. The implementation issues are also discussed},

In this article, we analyze and discuss the BLS-GSM algorithm, its drawbacks and benefits in more detail. An analytical parameter study of this denoising approach is provided as well. Additionally, we propose a localized version of this algorithm and experimentally show that it outperforms the original method both numerically and visually.

  doi = {10.1109/TIP.2008.925392},
  abstract = {Image denoising methods are often designed to minimize mean-squared error (MSE) within the subbands of a multi-scale decomposition. However, most high-quality denoising results have been obtained with overcomplete representations, for which minimization of MSE in the subband domain does not guarantee optimal MSE performance in the image domain. We prove that, despite this suboptimality, the expected image-domain MSE resulting from applying estimators to subbands that are made redundant through spatial replication of basis functions (e.g., cycle spinning) is always less than or equal to that resulting from applying the same estimators to the original nonredundant representation. In addition, we show that it is possible to further exploit overcompleteness by jointly optimizing the subband estimators for image-domain MSE. We develop an extended version of Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) that allows us to perform this optimization adaptively, for each observed noisy image. We demonstrate this methodology using a new class of estimator formed from linear combinations of localized ``bump'' functions that are applied either point-wise or on local neighborhoods of subband coefficients. We show through simulations that the performance of these estimators applied to overcomplete subbands and optimized for image-domain MSE is substantially better than that obtained when they are optimized within each subband. This performance is, in turn, substantially better than that obtained when they are optimized for use on a nonredundant representation.},

Vessel segmentation is fundamental in computer aided processing of data generated by 3D imaging modalities. As manual vessel segmentation is prohibitively time consuming, any real world application requires some form of automation. Several approaches exist for automated vessel segmentation, but judging their relative merits is difficult due to a lack of standardized evaluation. We present an annotated reference dataset containing 20 CT scans and propose nine categories to perform a comprehensive evaluation of vessel segmentation algorithms from both academia and industry. Twenty algorithms participated in the VESSEL12 challenge, held at International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2012. All results have been published at the VESSEL12 website http://vessel12.grand-challenge.org. The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Our three contributions are: (1) an annotated reference dataset available online for evaluation of new algorithms; (2) a quantitative scoring system for objective comparison of algorithms; and (3) performance analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the various vessel segmentation methods in the presence of various lung diseases.},

However, a significant percentage of contributions now are connected to theoretical mathematical areas, and the concept of wavelets continuously stretches across various disciplines of mathematics. Key topics:  Approximation and Fourier Analysis Construction of Wavelets and Frame Theory Fractal and Multifractal Theory Wavelets in Numerical Analysis Time-Frequency Analysis Adaptive Representation of Nonlinear and Non-stationary Signals Applications, particularly~in image processing Through the broad spectrum, ranging from pure and applied mathematics to real applications, the book will be most useful for researchers, engineers and developers alike.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes the models that researchers use to represent the conformations and dynamics of cytoskeletal and DNA filaments. It focuses on models that address individual filaments in continuous space. Conformation models include the freely jointed, Gaussian, angle-biased chain (ABC), and wormlike chain (WLC) models, of which the first three bend at discrete joints and the last bends continuously. Predictions from the WLC model generally agree well with experiment. Dynamics models include the Rouse, Zimm, stiff rod, dynamic WLC, and reptation models, of which the first four apply to isolated filaments and the last to entangled filaments. Experiments show that the dynamic WLC and reptation models are most accurate. They also show that biological filaments typically experience strong hydrodynamic coupling and/or constrained motion. Computer simulation methods that address filament dynamics typically compute filament segment velocities from local forces using the Langevin equation and then integrate these velocities with explicit or implicit methods; the former are more versatile and the latter are more efficient. Much remains to be discovered in biological filament modeling. In particular, filament dynamics in living cells are not well understood, and current computational methods are too slow and not sufficiently versatile. Although primarily a review, this paper also presents new statistical calculations for the ABC and WLC models. Additionally, it corrects several discrepancies in the literature about bending and torsional persistence length definitions, and their relations to flexural and torsional rigidities.},

  abstract = {Many image acquisition techniques used in biomedical imaging, material analysis, and structural geology are capable of acquiring 3D solid images. Computational analysis of these images is complex but necessary, since it is difficult for humans to visualize and quantify their detailed 3D content. One of the most common methods to analyze 3D data is to characterize the volumetric texture patterns. Texture analysis generally consists of encoding the local organization of image scales and directions, which can be extremely diverse in 3D. Current state-of-the-art techniques face many challenges when working with 3D solid texture, where most approaches are not able to consistently characterize both scale and directional information. 3D Riesz-wavelets can deal with both properties. One key property of Riesz filterbanks is steerability, which can be used to locally align the filters and compare textures with arbitrary (local) orientations. This paper proposes and compares three novel local alignment criteria for higher-order 3D Riesz-wavelet transforms. The estimations of local texture orientations are based on higher-order extensions of regularized structure tensors. An experimental evaluation of the proposed methods for the classification of synthetic 3D solid textures with alterations (such as rotations and noise) demonstrated the importance of local directional information for robust and accurate solid texture recognition. These alignment methods achieved an accuracy of 0.95 in the rotated data, three times more than the unaligned Riesz descriptor that achieved 0.32. The accuracy obtained is better than all other techniques that are published and tested on the same database.},

In the last few decades, various segmentation techniques of different accuracy and degree of complexity have been developed and reported in the literature. In this paper we review the most popular methods commonly used for brain MRI segmentation. We highlight differences between them and discuss their capabilities, advantages, and limitations. To address the complexity and challenges of the brain MRI segmentation problem, we first introduce the basic concepts of image segmentation. Then, we explain different MRI preprocessing steps including image registration, bias field correction, and removal of nonbrain tissue. Finally, after reviewing different brain MRI segmentation methods, we discuss the validation problem in brain MRI segmentation.},

In gravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, both contributions can be simultaneously squeezed in a broad frequency band by injecting a spectrum of squeezed vacuum states with a frequency-dependent squeeze angle. This approach requires setting up an additional long baseline, low-loss filter cavity in a vacuum system at the detector's site. Here, we show that the need for such a filter cavity can be eliminated, by exploiting Einstein\textendash{}Podolsky\textendash{}Rosen (EPR)-entangled signals and idler beams. By harnessing their mutual quantum correlations and the difference in the way each beam propagates in the interferometer, we can engineer the input signal beam to have the appropriate frequency-dependent conditional squeezing once the out-going idler beam is detected. Our proposal is appropriate for all future gravitational-wave detectors for achieving sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit.},

  title = {Automatic Quantification Framework to Detect Cracks in Teeth},
  abstract = {Studies show that cracked teeth are the third most common cause for tooth loss in industrialized countries. If
detected early and accurately, patients can retain their teeth for a longer time. However, the symptoms of
cracked teeth are often discontinuous leaving the cracks undetected. Also, currently used imaging modalities
like Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and intraoral radiography often have low resolution which do
not show cracks clearly. This paper introduces a novel method that can detect, quantify, and localize cracks
automatically in high resolution CBCT (hr-CBCT) scans of teeth using steerable wavelets and learning methods.
The preliminary results were created using a set of healthy teeth hr-CBCT scans, and the same scans with
simulated longitudinal cracks. The cracks were simulated using multiple orientations. The crack detection was
trained on the most significant wavelet coefficients at each scale using a bagged classifier of Support Vector
Machines. The preliminary results show high discriminative specificity and sensitivity of this method. The
framework aims to be automatic, reproducible, and open-source. Future work will focus on the clinical validation
of the proposed techniques on different types of cracks in-vivo. We believe that this work will ultimately lead to
improved tracking and detection of cracks allowing for longer lasting healthy teeth.},

  abstract = {Fibrin gels are biological networks that play a fundamental role in blood coagulation and other patho/physiological processes, such as thrombosis and cancer. Electron and confocal microscopies show a collection of fibers that are relatively monodisperse in diameter, not uniformly distributed, and connected at nodal points with a branching order of $\sim$3\textendash{}4. Although in the confocal images the hydrated fibers appear to be quite straight (mass fractal dimension Dm~= 1), for the overall system 1$<$Dm$<$2. Based on the confocal images, we developed a method to generate three-dimensional (3D) in~silico gels made of cylindrical sticks of diameter d, density $\rho$, and average length $\langle$L$\rangle$, joined at randomly distributed nodal points. The resulting 3D network strikingly resembles real fibrin gels and can be sketched as an assembly of densely packed fractal blobs, i.e., regions of size $\xi$, where the fiber concentration is higher than average. The blobs are placed at a distance $\xi$0 between their centers of mass so that they are overlapped by a factor $\eta$~= $\xi$/$\xi$0 and have Dm $\sim$1.2\textendash{}1.6. The in~silico gels' structure is quantitatively analyzed by its 3D spatial correlation function g3D(r) and corresponding power spectrum I(q)~= FFT3D[g3D(r)], from which $\rho$,~d, Dm, $\eta$, and $\xi$0 can be extracted. In particular, $\xi$0 provides an excellent estimate of the gel mesh size. The in~silico gels' I(q) compares quite well with real gels' elastic light-scattering measurements. We then derived an analytical form factor for accurately fitting the scattering data, which allowed us to directly recover the gels' structural parameters.},

  abstract = {The ability to obtain three-dimensional (3-D) information about morphologies of nanostructures elucidates many interesting properties of materials in both physical and biological sciences. Here we demonstrate a novel method in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that gives a fast and reliable assessment of the 3-D configuration of curvilinear nano﻿structures, all without needing to tilt the sample through an arc. Using one-dimensional crystalline defects known as dislocations as a prototypical example of a complex curvilinear object, we demonstrate their 3-D reconstruction two orders of magnitude faster than by standard tilt-arc TEM tomographic techniques, from data recorded by selecting different ray paths of the convergent STEM probe. Due to its speed and immunity to problems associated with a tilt arc, the tilt-less 3-D imaging offers important advantages for investigations of radiation-sensitive, polycrystalline, or magnetic materials. Further, by using a segmented detector, the total electron dose is reduced to a single STEM raster scan acquisition; our tilt-less approach will therefore open new avenues for real-time 3-D electron imaging of dynamic processes.},

  title = {Wavelet-{{Based Segmentation}} on the {{Sphere}}},
  abstract = {Segmentation is the process of identifying object outlines within images. There are a number of efficient algorithms for segmentation in Euclidean space that depend on the variational approach and partial differential equation modelling. Wavelets have been used successfully in various problems in image processing, including segmentation, inpainting, noise removal, super-resolution image restoration, and many others. Wavelets on the sphere have been developed to solve such problems for data defined on the sphere, which arise in numerous fields such as cosmology and geophysics. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based method to segment images on the sphere, accounting for the underlying geometry of spherical data. Our method is a direct extension of the tight-frame based segmentation method used to automatically identify tube-like structures such as blood vessels in medical imaging. It is compatible with any arbitrary type of wavelet frame defined on the sphere, such as axisymmetric wavelets, directional wavelets, curvelets, and hybrid wavelet constructions. Such an approach allows the desirable properties of wavelets to be naturally inherited in the segmentation process. In particular, directional wavelets and curvelets, which were designed to efficiently capture directional signal content, provide additional advantages in segmenting images containing prominent directional and curvilinear features. We present several numerical experiments, applying our wavelet-based segmentation method, as well as the common K-means method, on real-world spherical images. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and show that it is capable of segmenting different kinds of spherical images, including those with prominent directional features. Moreover, our algorithm is efficient with convergence usually within a few iterations.},

  abstract = {One of the most frequently used notions of "structured sparsity" is that of sparse (discrete) gradients, a structure typically elicited through $\backslash$emph\{Total-Variation (TV)\} regularizers. This paper focuses on anisotropic TV-regularizers, in particular on \$$\backslash$ell\_p\$-norm $\backslash$emph\{weighted TV regularizers\} for which it develops efficient algorithms to compute the corresponding proximity operators. Our algorithms enable one to scalably incorporate TV regularization of vector, matrix, or tensor data into a proximal convex optimization solvers. For the special case of vectors, we derive and implement a highly efficient weighted 1D-TV solver. This solver provides a backbone for subsequently handling the more complex task of higher-dimensional (two or more) TV by means of a modular proximal optimization approach. We present numerical experiments that demonstrate how our 1D-TV solver matches or exceeds the best known 1D-TV solvers. Thereafter, we illustrate the benefits of our modular design through extensive experiments on: (i) image denoising; (ii) image deconvolution; and (iii) four variants of fused-lasso. Our results show the flexibility and speed our TV solvers offer over competing approaches. To underscore our claims, we provide our TV solvers in an easy to use multi-threaded C++ library (which also aids reproducibility of our results).},

The gelation behaviour of mixed HM/LM pectin gels was compared to that of HM and LM pectin gels in the presence of 30\%, 45\% and 60\% sucrose. The gels were investigated in the presence of 0.1\% CaCl2$\cdot$2H2O and pH 3.5, conditions that favour the gel formation of both HM and LM pectins. Strong synergistic effects occurred in the rheological behaviour for three mixed 0.8\% HM/0.4\% LM pectin gels under conditions where LM pectin formed microgels instead of coherent gels. The addition of LM pectin strongly increased the storage modulus in mixed HM/LM pectin gels based on 60\% and 45\% sucrose compared to HM pectin gels of the same sucrose concentration. The kinetic behaviour of the mixed HM/LM pectin gels during gel formation varied depending on the kinetic behaviour of the HM pectins differing in degrees of blockiness. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the gel microstructure of the mixed gel with 60\% sucrose was inhomogeneous. The addition of HM pectin in mixed gels with only 30\% sucrose increased the storage modulus two to five times compared to that of 0.4\% LM pectin gels under the same conditions. The phase angle for the mixed gel with 30\% sucrose was also higher than for the corresponding 0.4\% LM pectin gel.},

The low-methoxyl (LM) pectin gels were characterized in the presence of Ca2+ by oscillatory measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The appearance of the gel microstructure varied with the pH, the gel structure being sparse and aggregated at pH 3 but dense and somewhat entangled at pH 7. During gel formation of pectins G and C30 at pH 3 there was a rapid increase in G? initially followed by a small increase with time. At pH 7 G? increased very rapidly at first but then remained constant. The presence of sucrose influenced neither the kinetic behavior nor the microstructure of the gels but strongly increased the storage modulus. Pectins G and C30 showed large variations in G? at pH values 3, 4, 5, and 7 in the presence of sucrose, and the maximum in G? in the samples occurred at different pH values. Due to its high Ca2+ sensitivity, pectin sG had a storage modulus that was about 50 times higher than that of its mother pectin G at pH 7.},

Gel formation of either the HM or LM pectin, or both, was initiated in the mixed gels by varying the sucrose and Ca2+ content. The microstructure was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, light microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. HM and LM pectin gels showed aggregated networks with large pores around 500 nm and network strands of similar character. Small differences could be found, such as a more inhomogeneous LM pectin network with shorter and more branched strands of flexible appearance. LM pectin also formed a weak gel in 60\% sucrose in the absence of calcium. A highly inhomogeneous mixed gel structure was formed in the presence of 60\% sucrose and Ca2+ ions, which showed large synergistic effects in rheological properties. Its formation was explained by the behavior of the corresponding pure gels. In the presence of 60\% sucrose alone, a homogeneous, fine-stranded mixed network was formed, which showed weak synergistic effects. It is suggested that LM pectin interacts with HM pectin during gel formation, thereby hindering secondary aggregation leading to the aggregated networks observed for the pure gels.},

In situ, we observed an irreversible transformation of the hydrated bacterial extracellular polymers during the traditional dehydration-based sample preparation that resulted in their collapse into filamentous structures. Dehydration-induced polymer collapse can lead to inaccurate spatial relationships and hence could subsequently affect conclusions regarding the nature of interactions between microbial extracellular polymers and their environment.},

Current models suggest that HG is deposited into the wall as a highly methylesterified polymer, demethylesterified by pectin methylesterase enzymes and cross-linked by calcium ions to form a gel. However, this idea is based largely on indirect evidence and in vitro studies. We took advantage of the wall architecture of the unicellular alga Penium margaritaceum, which forms an elaborate calcium cross-linked HG-rich lattice on its cell surface, to test this model and other aspects of pectin dynamics. Studies of live cells and microscopic imaging of wall domains confirmed that the degree of methylesterification and sufficient levels of calcium are critical for lattice formation in vivo. Pectinase treatments of live cells and immunological studies suggested the presence of another class of pectin polymer, rhamnogalacturonan I, and indicated its colocalization and structural association with HG. Carbohydrate microarray analysis of the walls of P. margaritaceum, Physcomitrella patens, and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) further suggested the conservation of pectin organization and interpolymer associations in the walls of green plants. The individual constituent HG polymers also have a similar size and branched structure to those of embryophytes. The HG-rich lattice of P. margaritaceum, a member of the charophyte green algae, the immediate ancestors of land plants, was shown to be important for cell adhesion. Therefore, the calcium-HG gel at the cell surface may represent an early evolutionary innovation that paved the way for an adhesive middle lamella in multicellular land plants.},

  abstract = {Overview Notions of community quality underlie the clustering of networks. While studies surrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding of the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In this paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality metrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four widely-used network clustering algorithms\textemdash{}Louvain, Infomap, label propagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality metrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the information recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual information, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes varying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes.   Cluster Quality Metrics We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster quality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4 out of 1 on modularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find conductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best indicates performance on the information recovery metrics. Additionally, our study shows that the variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be assumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information.   Network Clustering Algorithms Smart local moving is the overall best performing algorithm in our study, but discrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it an absolutely superior algorithm. Interestingly, Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the tests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap was superior to Louvain. We find that although label propagation performs poorly when clusters are less clearly defined, it scales efficiently and accurately to large graphs with well-defined clusters.},

  abstract = {The influence of the microstructures of different kappa-carrageenan gels on the self-diffusion behavior of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the diffusion behavior was determined mainly by the void size, which in turn was defined by the state of aggregation of the kappa-carrageenan. The kappa-carrageenan concentration was held constant at 1 w/w\%, and the aggregation was controlled by the amount of potassium and/or sodium chloride and, for samples containing potassium, also by the cooling rate. Gels containing potassium formed microstructures where kappa-carrageenan strands are rather evenly distributed over the image size, while sodium gels formed dense biopolymer clusters interspersed with large openings. In a gel with small void sizes, relatively slow diffusion was found for all PEG sizes investigated. Extended studies of the self-diffusion behavior of the 634 g mol(-)(1) PEG showed that there is a strong time dependence in the measured PEG diffusion. An asymptotic lower time limit of the diffusion coefficient was found in all gels when the diffusion observation time was increased. According to the ratio, D/D(0), where D(0) is the diffusion coefficient in D(2)O and D is the diffusion coefficient in the gels, the gels could be divided into three classes: small, medium, and large voids. For quenched kappa-carrageenan solutions with salt concentrations of 20 mM K(+), 100 mM K(+), or 20 mM K(+)/200 mM Na(+) as well as slowly cooled solutions with only 20 mM K(+), D/D(0) ratios between 0.18 and 0.29 were obtained. By quenching a kappa-carrageenan solution with 100 mM K(+), the D/D(0) was 0.5, while D/D(0) ratios between 0.9 and 1 were obtained in a quenched solution with 250 mM Na(+) and slowly cooled samples with 20 mM K(+)/200 mM Na(+) or 250 mM Na(+).},

Different salt conditions of KCl, NaCl, and mixtures thereof allowed for formation of significantly different microstructures. The $\kappa$-carrageenan concentrations were varied between 0.25 and 3.0 w/w\% for a salt mixture containing 20 mM KCl and 200 mM NaCl gels and between 0.5 and 4.0 w/w\% for 250 mM NaCl gels. Furthermore, the effect of potassium ion concentration on the gel structure and the dendrimer diffusion rate was determined. The potassium ion concentration was varied between 20 mM KCl and 200 mM KCl. Two different dendrimer generations with significant difference in size were used: G2 and G6. Dendrimers were found to be sensitive probes for determination of the effect of the gel microstructure on molecular diffusion rate. A qualitative comparison between TEM micrographs, NMR diffusometry data and image analysis showed that the gel structure has a large impact on the dendrimers diffusion in $\kappa$-carrageenan gels. It was found that diffusion was strongly influenced by the $\kappa$-carrageenan concentration and the dendrimer generation. Small voids in the gel network gave strongly reduced diffusion. Image analysis revealed that the interfacial area between the gel network and the surrounding water phase correlated well with the dendrimer diffusion.},

The success of embedding samples in plastic lies in the astounding resilience of the sections in the electron microscope, albeit after initial changes. The electron microscope image results from projection of the sample density in the direction of the beam, i.e. through the depth of the section, and therefore is independent of physical changes in this direction. In contrast, the basis of electron tomography is the constancy of the physical state of the whole section during the time that different views at incremental tilt angle steps are recorded.},

  abstract = {Polysaccharide gels assembled from the anionic biopolymers pectin and carrageenan have been studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Gels were formed in several different ways: for pectin, hydrogen bonding was used to form junction zones between strands, whereas for carrageenan systems, several different ion types were used to form ionotropic networks. Using this approach, several distinct network architectures were realized. In addition to preparing gelled samples for electron microscopy, a set of samples was taken without performing the additional treatment necessitated by the TEM measurements, and these were studied directly by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Taking careful consideration of the relative merits of different image sizes and available processing techniques, the real-space images acquired by TEM were used via radial integration of the Fourier transform to produce simulated scattering patterns. These intensity-versus-wavevector plots were compared with the results of SAXS experiments carried out on the unadulterated gels using synchrotron radiation. Although information regarding chain thicknesses and flexibilities was found to be modified by labeling and changes in the dielectric constant and mechanical properties of the surroundings in the TEM, the studies carried out here show that careful protocols can produce data sets where information acquired above $\sim$20 nm is broadly consistent with that obtained by SAXS studies carried out on unadulterated samples. The fact that at larger length scale the structure of these water-rich networks seems largely preserved in the TEM samples suggests that three-dimensional (3D) TEM tomography experiments carried out with careful sample preparation will be valuable tools for measuring network architecture and connectivity; information that is lost in SAXS owing to the intrinsic averaging nature of the technique.},

We take advantage of the properties of this framework, to propose a generic thinning scheme for obtaining ``thin'' skeletons from objects made of voxels. From this scheme, we derive algorithms that produce curve or surface skeletons, based on the notion of 1D or 2D isthmus. We compare our new curve thinning algorithm with all the published algorithms of the same kind, based on quantitative criteria. Our experiments show that our algorithm largely outperforms the other ones with respect to noise sensitivity. Furthermore, we show how to slightly modify our algorithms to include a filtering parameter that controls effectively the pruning of skeletons, based on the notion of isthmus persistence.},

  abstract = {Glutaraldehyde has been used for several decades as an effective crosslinking agent for many applications including sample fixation for microscopy, enzyme and cell immobilization, and stabilization of protein crystals. Despite of its common use as a crosslinking agent, the mechanism and chemistry involved in glutaraldehyde crosslinking reaction is not yet fully understood. Here we describe feasibility study and results obtained from a new approach to investigate the process of protein crystals stabilization by glutaraldehyde crosslinking. It involves exposure of a model protein crystal (Lysozyme) to glutaraldehyde in alkaline or acidic pH for different incubation periods and reaction arrest by medium exchange with crystallization medium to remove unbound glutaraldehyde. The crystals were subsequently incubated in diluted buffer affecting dissolution of un-crosslinked crystals. Samples from the resulting solution were subjected to protein composition analysis by gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy while crosslinked, dissolution resistant crystals were subjected to high resolution X-ray structural analysis. Data from gel electrophoresis indicated that the crosslinking process starts at specific preferable crosslinking site by lysozyme dimer formation, for both acidic and alkaline pH values. These dimer formations were followed by trimer and tetramer formations leading eventually to dissolution resistant crystals. The crosslinking initiation site and the end products obtained from glutaraldehyde crosslinking in both pH ranges resulted from reactions between lysine residues of neighboring protein molecules and the polymeric form of glutaraldehyde. Reaction rate was much faster at alkaline pH. Different reaction end products, indicating different reaction mechanisms, were identified for crosslinking taking place under alkaline or acidic conditions.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the spatial characteristics of nonzero rain rates to develop a probability density function (PDF) model of precipitation using rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The minimum ␹ 2 method is used to find a good estimator for the rain-rate distribution between the gamma and lognormal distributions, which are popularly used in the simulation of the rain-rate PDF. Results are sensitive to the choice of dynamic range, but both the gamma and lognormal distributions match well with the PDF of rainfall data. Comparison with sample means shows that the parametric mean from the lognormal distribution overestimates the sample mean, whereas the gamma distribution underestimates it. These differences are caused by the inflated tail in the lognormal distribution and the small shape parameter in the gamma distribution. If shape constraint is given, the difference between the sample mean and the parametric mean from the fitted gamma distribution decreases significantly, although the resulting ␹ 2 values slightly increase. Of interest is that a consistent regional preference between two test functions is found. The gamma fits outperform the lognormal fits in wet regions, whereas the lognormal fits are better than the gamma fits for dry regions. Results can be improved with a specific model assumption depending on mean rain rates, but the results presented in this study can be easily applied to develop the rainfall retrieval algorithm and to find the proper statistics in the rainfall data.},

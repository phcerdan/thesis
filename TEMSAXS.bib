  abstract = {The structural conformations of the anionic carrageenan polysaccharides in the presence of monovalent salt close to physiological conditions are studied by atomic force microscopy. Iota-carrageenan undergoes a coil\textendash{}helix transition at high ionic strength, whereas lambda-carrageenan remains in the coiled state. Polymer statistical analysis reveals an increase in persistence length from 22.6$\pm$0.2\hspace{0.25em}nm in the random coil, to 26.4$\pm$0.2\hspace{0.25em}nm in the ordered helical conformation, indicating an increased rigidity of the helical iota-carrageenan chains. The many decades-long debated issue on whether the ordered state can exist as single or double helix, is conclusively resolved by demonstrating the existence of a unimeric helix formed intramolecularly by a single polymer chain.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the rheological behaviour of mixed gels of high methoxyl (HM) and low methoxyl (LM) pectins with the purpose of designing gels with reduced sucrose content but unaltered rheological properties. The gelation behaviour of mixed HM/LM pectin gels was compared to that of HM and LM pectin gels in the presence of 30\%, 45\% and 60\% sucrose. The gels were investigated in the presence of 0.1\% CaCl2$\cdot$2H2O and pH 3.5, conditions that favour the gel formation of both HM and LM pectins. Strong synergistic effects occurred in the rheological behaviour for three mixed 0.8\% HM/0.4\% LM pectin gels under conditions where LM pectin formed microgels instead of coherent gels. The addition of LM pectin strongly increased the storage modulus in mixed HM/LM pectin gels based on 60\% and 45\% sucrose compared to HM pectin gels of the same sucrose concentration. The kinetic behaviour of the mixed HM/LM pectin gels during gel formation varied depending on the kinetic behaviour of the HM pectins differing in degrees of blockiness. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the gel microstructure of the mixed gel with 60\% sucrose was inhomogeneous. The addition of HM pectin in mixed gels with only 30\% sucrose increased the storage modulus two to five times compared to that of 0.4\% LM pectin gels under the same conditions. The phase angle for the mixed gel with 30\% sucrose was also higher than for the corresponding 0.4\% LM pectin gel.},

  abstract = {Frustrated, out-of-equilibrium materials have been of considerable interest for some time and continue to be some of the least understood materials. Recent measurements have shown that many gelled biopolymer materials display slow dynamics on timescales greater than one second, that are not accessible with typical methods, and are characteristic of glassy trapped systems. In this study we have controlled the fine structure of the anionic polysaccharide pectin in order to construct a series of ionotropic gels having differing binding energies between the constituent chains, in an attempt to further understand the slow dynamical processes occurring. Using multi-speckle light scattering techniques it is shown that the slow dynamics observed in these gelled systems are stress-driven. As the binding lengths, and thus the binding energies, of the junction zones between the polymer chains in these networks increase the long-time dynamics initially slow, as might be expected, until a critical level of internal stress is reached upon which the dynamics increase significantly, with gentle creaking punctuated by localised stress-relieving quakes.},

  abstract = {Self-assembled hydrogen-bonded networks of the polysaccharide pectin, a mechanically functional component of plant cell walls, have been of recent interest as biomimetic exemplars of physical gels, and the micro-rheological and strain-stiffening behaviour have been previously investigated. Despite this detailed rheological characterisation of pre-formed gels, little is known about the fundamental arrangement of the polymers into cross-linking junction zones, the size of these bonded regions, and the resultant network architecture in these hydrogen-bonded materials, especially in contrast to the plethora of such information available for their well-known calcium-assembled counterparts. In this work, in concert with pertinent rheological measurements, an in-depth structural study of the hydrogen-bond-mediated gelation of pectins is provided. Gels were realised by using glucona-delta-lactone (GDL) to decrease the pH of solutions of pectic polymers that had a (blockwise) low degree of methylesterification (low DM). Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to access structural information on length scales on the order of nanometres to hundreds of nanometres, while complementary mechanical properties were measured, predominantly using small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology.},

The low-methoxyl (LM) pectin gels were characterized in the presence of Ca2+ by oscillatory measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The appearance of the gel microstructure varied with the pH, the gel structure being sparse and aggregated at pH 3 but dense and somewhat entangled at pH 7. During gel formation of pectins G and C30 at pH 3 there was a rapid increase in G? initially followed by a small increase with time. At pH 7 G? increased very rapidly at first but then remained constant. The presence of sucrose influenced neither the kinetic behavior nor the microstructure of the gels but strongly increased the storage modulus. Pectins G and C30 showed large variations in G? at pH values 3, 4, 5, and 7 in the presence of sucrose, and the maximum in G? in the samples occurred at different pH values. Due to its high Ca2+ sensitivity, pectin sG had a storage modulus that was about 50 times higher than that of its mother pectin G at pH 7.},

  abstract = {The influence of the microstructures of different ?-carrageenan gels on the self-diffusion behavior of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the diffusion behavior was determined mainly by the void size, which in turn was defined by the state of aggregation of the ?-carrageenan. The ?-carrageenan concentration was held constant at 1 w/w\%, and the aggregation was controlled by the amount of potassium and/or sodium chloride and, for samples containing potassium, also by the cooling rate. Gels containing potassium formed microstructures where ?-carrageenan strands are rather evenly distributed over the image size, while sodium gels formed dense biopolymer clusters interspersed with large openings. In a gel with small void sizes, relatively slow diffusion was found for all PEG sizes investigated. Extended studies of the self-diffusion behavior of the 634 g mol-1 PEG showed that there is a strong time dependence in the measured PEG diffusion. An asymptotic lower time limit of the diffusion coefficient was found in all gels when the diffusion observation time was increased. According to the ratio, D/D0, where D0 is the diffusion coefficient in D2O and D is the diffusion coefficient in the gels, the gels could be divided into three classes:? small, medium, and large voids. For quenched ?-carrageenan solutions with salt concentrations of 20 mM K+, 100 mM K+, or 20 mM K+/200 mM Na+ as well as slowly cooled solutions with only 20 mM K+, D/D0 ratios between 0.18 and 0.29 were obtained. By quenching a ?-carrageenan solution with 100 mM K+, the D/D0 was 0.5, while D/D0 ratios between 0.9 and 1 were obtained in a quenched solution with 250 mM Na+ and slowly cooled samples with 20 mM K+/200 mM Na+ or 250 mM Na+.},

In this case, it is well-known that polysaccharides, rather than filamentous and tubular protein assemblies, play a major role in satisfying the mechanical requirements of a successful cell wall, but developing a clear structure\textendash{}function understanding has been exacerbated by the familiar issue of biological complexity. Herein, in the spirit of the mesoscopic approaches that have proved so illuminating in the study of cytoskeletal networks, the linear microrheological and strain-stiffening responses of biopolymeric networks reconstituted from pectin, a crucial cell wall polysaccharide, are examined. These are found to be well-captured by the glassy worm-like chain (GWLC) model of self-assembled semi-flexible filaments. Strikingly, the nonlinear mechanical response of these pectin networks is found to be much more sensitive to temperature changes than their linear response, a property that is also observed in F-actin networks, and is well reproduced by the GWLC model. Additionally, microrheological measurements suggest that over long timescales ($>$10 s) internal stresses continue to redistribute facilitating low frequency motions of tracer particles.},

It was ascertained that two the length scales that characterize the gel network (diameter of polymer chain and typical mesh size of the gel network) can be determined quantitatively by a 3-d box-counting analysis and a 3-d Fourier transform (FT) analysis to obtain the power spectra. Turbidity measurements were employed for the determination of average fiber diameter. Self-similar structure of the gel network was found to be realized in the range between those two scales. The fibrin gels formed by larger amounts of thrombin showed a smaller fractal dimension that, deduced by the box-counting method, was in good agreement with the result from 3-d FT analysis and with a recent dynamic light scattering study (Kita R. et al. (2002) Biomacromolecules 3:1013).},

  abstract = {The mechanical properties of soft biological tissues are essential to their physiological function and cannot easily be duplicated by synthetic materials. Unlike simple polymer gels, many biological materials\textemdash{}including blood vessels, mesentery tissue, lung parenchyma, cornea and blood clots\textemdash{}stiffen as they are strained, thereby preventing large deformations that could threaten tissue integrity. The molecular structures and design principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress\textendash{}strain relations at low to intermediate strains. The input to this theory is the force\textendash{}extension curve for individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these filaments are homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly. This theory shows that systems of filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen at low strains without requiring a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffness.},

  abstract = {The microstructure and the rheological properties of pure HM (high methoxyl) and LM (low methoxyl) pectin gels and of mixed HM/LM pectin gels have been investigated. Gel formation of either the HM or LM pectin, or both, was initiated in the mixed gels by varying the sucrose and Ca2+ content. The microstructure was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, light microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. HM and LM pectin gels showed aggregated networks with large pores around 500 nm and network strands of similar character. Small differences could be found, such as a more inhomogeneous LM pectin network with shorter and more branched strands of flexible appearance. LM pectin also formed a weak gel in 60\% sucrose in the absence of calcium. A highly inhomogeneous mixed gel structure was formed in the presence of 60\% sucrose and Ca2+ ions, which showed large synergistic effects in rheological properties. Its formation was explained by the behavior of the corresponding pure gels. In the presence of 60\% sucrose alone, a homogeneous, fine-stranded mixed network was formed, which showed weak synergistic effects. It is suggested that LM pectin interacts with HM pectin during gel formation, thereby hindering secondary aggregation leading to the aggregated networks observed for the pure gels.},

Fractal analysis based on the spectral dimension is used, for the first time, to characterise fibrin gel microstructure in terms of the internal connectivity of gel networks. A significant correlation is found between the fractal characteristics of the incipient gel network and its eventual mature form, confirming that incipient gel microstructure templates ensuing gel development. We report an analytical basis for the study of this templating effect which reveals two different regimes of microstructural development. The first involves low thrombin concentration, in which increasing concentration decreases the gel formation time and alters the fractal characteristics of both incipient and mature gels. In the second regime, involving higher thrombin concentrations, the incipient gel formation time and the fractal characteristics of incipient and mature gels show little variation. The network formation is discussed in terms of computer simulations of incipient fractal networks by the activation-limited aggregation of clusters of rod-like particles. The significance of the work is discussed in terms of biomaterials design for applications involving controlled drug release and wound healing, and improved predictions of blood clot susceptibility to lysis.},

  abstract = {One of the most frequently used notions of "structured sparsity" is that of sparse (discrete) gradients, a structure typically elicited through $\backslash$emph\{Total-Variation (TV)\} regularizers. This paper focuses on anisotropic TV-regularizers, in particular on \$$\backslash$ell\_p\$-norm $\backslash$emph\{weighted TV regularizers\} for which it develops efficient algorithms to compute the corresponding proximity operators. Our algorithms enable one to scalably incorporate TV regularization of vector, matrix, or tensor data into a proximal convex optimization solvers. For the special case of vectors, we derive and implement a highly efficient weighted 1D-TV solver. This solver provides a backbone for subsequently handling the more complex task of higher-dimensional (two or more) TV by means of a modular proximal optimization approach. We present numerical experiments that demonstrate how our 1D-TV solver matches or exceeds the best known 1D-TV solvers. Thereafter, we illustrate the benefits of our modular design through extensive experiments on: (i) image denoising; (ii) image deconvolution; and (iii) four variants of fused-lasso. Our results show the flexibility and speed our TV solvers offer over competing approaches. To underscore our claims, we provide our TV solvers in an easy to use multi-threaded C++ library (which also aids reproducibility of our results).},

  abstract = {Fibrin gels are biological networks that play a fundamental role in blood coagulation and other patho/physiological processes, such as thrombosis and cancer. Electron and confocal microscopies show a collection of fibers that are relatively monodisperse in diameter, not uniformly distributed, and connected at nodal points with a branching order of $\sim$3\textendash{}4. Although in the confocal images the hydrated fibers appear to be quite straight (mass fractal dimension Dm~= 1), for the overall system 1$<$Dm$<$2. Based on the confocal images, we developed a method to generate three-dimensional (3D) in~silico gels made of cylindrical sticks of diameter d, density $\rho$, and average length 〈L〉, joined at randomly distributed nodal points. The resulting 3D network strikingly resembles real fibrin gels and can be sketched as an assembly of densely packed fractal blobs, i.e., regions of size $\xi$, where the fiber concentration is higher than average. The blobs are placed at a distance $\xi$0 between their centers of mass so that they are overlapped by a factor $\eta$~= $\xi$/$\xi$0 and have Dm $\sim$1.2\textendash{}1.6. The in~silico gels' structure is quantitatively analyzed by its 3D spatial correlation function g3D(r) and corresponding power spectrum I(q)~= FFT3D[g3D(r)], from which $\rho$,~d, Dm, $\eta$, and $\xi$0 can be extracted. In particular, $\xi$0 provides an excellent estimate of the gel mesh size. The in~silico gels' I(q) compares quite well with real gels' elastic light-scattering measurements. We then derived an analytical form factor for accurately fitting the scattering data, which allowed us to directly recover the gels' structural parameters.},

Herein, we present a direct comparative analysis of microbial interactions by conventional electron microscopy approaches with imaging at room temperature and a suite of cryogenic electron microscopy methods providing imaging in the close-to-natural hydrated state. In situ, we observed an irreversible transformation of the hydrated bacterial extracellular polymers during the traditional dehydration-based sample preparation that resulted in their collapse into filamentous structures. Dehydration-induced polymer collapse can lead to inaccurate spatial relationships and hence could subsequently affect conclusions regarding the nature of interactions between microbial extracellular polymers and their environment.},

Current models suggest that HG is deposited into the wall as a highly methylesterified polymer, demethylesterified by pectin methylesterase enzymes and cross-linked by calcium ions to form a gel. However, this idea is based largely on indirect evidence and in vitro studies. We took advantage of the wall architecture of the unicellular alga Penium margaritaceum, which forms an elaborate calcium cross-linked HG-rich lattice on its cell surface, to test this model and other aspects of pectin dynamics. Studies of live cells and microscopic imaging of wall domains confirmed that the degree of methylesterification and sufficient levels of calcium are critical for lattice formation in vivo. Pectinase treatments of live cells and immunological studies suggested the presence of another class of pectin polymer, rhamnogalacturonan I, and indicated its colocalization and structural association with HG. Carbohydrate microarray analysis of the walls of P. margaritaceum, Physcomitrella patens, and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) further suggested the conservation of pectin organization and interpolymer associations in the walls of green plants. The individual constituent HG polymers also have a similar size and branched structure to those of embryophytes. The HG-rich lattice of P. margaritaceum, a member of the charophyte green algae, the immediate ancestors of land plants, was shown to be important for cell adhesion. Therefore, the calcium-HG gel at the cell surface may represent an early evolutionary innovation that paved the way for an adhesive middle lamella in multicellular land plants.},

  abstract = {The viscoelastic and microstructural influences of 0.1-0.6\% locust bean gum on 0.5 or 1.0\% $\kappa$-carrageenan gels, in different ionic environments, have been studied using small deformation oscillatory measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results from the Theological measurements showed synergistic effects in the storage modulus, G', as locust bean gum, of two different mannose to galactose ratios (3 and 5), was mixed with ion-exchanged Na- and Ca-$\kappa$-carrageenan, in 0.25 M NaCl and 0.030 M CaC12, respectively. The increase in G' was dependent on the mannose to galactose ratio, polymer concentrations, and ionic environment. At the supermolecular level, the microstructure of dilute samples has been visualised using low angle rotary metal shadowing for TEM. In the presence of sodium and calcium ions, the self-association of $\kappa$-carrageenan helices is moderate to low. Locust bean gum did not influence the supermolecular structure of $\kappa$-carrageenan to any large extent. The microstructure of the gels at the network level was studied using plastic embedding and thin sectioning for TEM. In both sodium and calcium ionic environments, the mixed gels showed a more homogeneous and connective network structure.},

  abstract = {In this work, the morphological characteristics of a calcium alginate gel and a binary (gel) mixture composed of (calcium) alginate and lactose-modified chitosan (chitlac) are evaluated and compared to quantify the differences between the two three-dimensional (3D) structures. A set of textural descriptors based on histogram analysis as well as on gray level co-occurrence matrix and on fractal dimension is extracted from transmission electron microscopy micrographs to describe the morphological differences that the images present. The obtained results reveal significant quantitative morphological differences between the calcium alginate gel and the binary gel mixture that were already inferred from rheological experiments, so as to provide a structural basis for developing new encapsulation systems based on such mixed polymer gels.},
